        "text": "Anybody want to read about something happy about poop? Epidemiologists have oddly learned that testing viral loads of municipal sewage is a remarkably accurate predictor of what will happen with cases, about a week in advance. This is proposed to be because this provides a comprehensive sample that includes asymptomatic cases, those that avoid healthcare or rely on non reported home tests, and may reflect viral loads. This correlation has proven accurate in many many municipalities across the last two years and therefore is increasingly more trusted. Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen. In the US they seem to have peaked and are falling. In this one article the slope seems to be falling really fast. [url] [url] More info about how and why this is done: [url]",

If you can still get severely ill and die with the vaccine than its an objectively bad vaccine. Really loosing trust and faith in the vaccine.

        "text": "So Paulo (Brazils biggest city, with a whopping 11m population) has pretty much vaccinated 99% of its population with the first dose as of today. Countrywise, 75% of all adults have received at least one dose and this number is still growing, as the rollout is now focused on young adults (18-25) who werent eligible to get their jab before. While this might seem a vaccine success story, it did not come without its hurdles. Vaccine rollout has been dramatic, to say the least. Bolsonaro is an anti-vaccine apologist and has sabotaged vaccine purchases since they first came. Being the 2nd worst affected country in the world, with over 500k dead, didnt change his heart. In stark contrast to other national leaders on the world, he did not get his jab and does not plan to do so. Skepticism and politicization of vaccines soon struck. We are screwed, I thought. Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US. Young people werent likely to get their jab this year. But somehow, it happened. Despite being disdained by the federal government, vaccines were soon became a representation of hope, soon became something the people needed to fight for if we were to have any chance against this disease. Little by little, Brazilian social media feeds were flooded with pics and videos of people being vaccinated. They put on their best clothes, posting their photos with inspiring takes on the importance of vaccines on Instagram. There is even a joke running here this vaccine only works if you post about it on social media This kind of good and organic peer pressure paid off - upon seeing their friends and relatives getting their jab, most Bolsonaro supporters reluctantly jumped in line to get their jab, even those people would avoid being excluded by their families. Against all odds, we are making it. We dont have many fully vaccinated people yet (just 30% of adult population). Peer pressure and social media work wonders. Close people getting their shot and sharing their experiences work better than some celebrity endorsements and free ice cream.",

Had it for about a couple of weeks now. I went to the doctor and he suggested I get a covid test. Have one scheduled for tomorrow morning. I have to admit, quite nervous about it. Not only the result, but the test itself. My housemate spent Saturday at the ER for an unrelated issue and they gave her a covid test and hers was negative. She also told me that it hurt really bad and that she had tears in her eyes from it. She's really the only one I've seen or been close to though for more than 5 seconds.

I am so afraid. I have been having constant nausea and stomach pain for the past month, and I tried to just ignore it but this morning it was excruciating. I folded and went to the ER (even the thought of it was terrifying to me, but the pain was so bad). I was there for about 2 hours, had blood work and a CT done, nothing serious found, was prescribed some medication and my stomach ailment should be better soon thats good, right? Yeah. My anxiety about that has evaporated, but now Im hyper focused on the possibility that I was exposed to COVID while I was there. Delta is going crazy, and they treat plenty of COVID patients at that hospital just thinking of how many covid positive individuals shared a chair with me in the waiting room or my recliner in the hospital room makes me shudder. Im utterly terrified. I came into close-ish contact with nine hospital employees in that two hours. No interaction lasted more than 15 minutes, most being shorter. Everyone was masked. Ive tried to search for others posts worried about a similar issue, but I havent really found much Im just so scared, guys. It hasnt even been eight hours since I left the hospital and Im already a nervous wreck. How will I possibly survive the next two weeks worrying :( I know I sound silly. Im sorry",

They doubled the cost of university courses during this pandemic, when the uni experience is no longer even half as good as it was.

Do I need to self isolate? We both go to the same university and he said student health would reach out to me with info but they have not sent me anything yet. I have no symptoms. 3. Does anyone have testimonies of similar situations where you had to live with someone who got COVID? Did you end up getting sick? What did you do? Let me know, and thanks for the help!",

        "text": "Hi all, I'm currently in Melbourne Australia, where we're currently in lockdown. You probably remember Australia having a reputation for handling the pandemic well last year. Unfortunately, due to the bungled vaccine rollout in our country as well as the Delta variant that reputation has been destroyed in 2021. We are currently at our absolute worst point since the pandemic started. Today we got 1435 cases, which I know if you're from America or Europe you might roll your eyes at us and think this number is tiny, but to us this is huge and unbelievably demoralising. We're poised to get out of lockdown around October 28th which is when we're predicted to hit 70% double dosed and we'll have more freedoms once we're 80% double dosed. But there is a huge fear of the hospitals being overrun here when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths skyrocketing and having to go back into lockdown even at high vaccination rates. I am feeling so defeated right now, although I am fully vaxxed so its some comfort to be protected. I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire. Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? Thanks.",

        "text": "So last friday, my mom got a bit sick. We weren't really worried, since she has the best immune system out of all the family members, although she has been badly sick around 4-5 times ever since I'm alive, and I'm 20. To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications. Also, if anybody here had the same symptoms (burning stomach, burning chest or the headache without fever), please feel free to share any tips that helped you or helped someone else you know. Thank you!",

I had covid back in spring and I was lucky that it was mild, I know many others are not so lucky. It especially sucks since I've been having good things happening to me for the first time in years, like changing my career path by going back to school and enjoying it.

Epidemiologists have oddly learned that testing viral loads of municipal sewage is a remarkably accurate predictor of what will happen with cases, about a week in advance. This is proposed to be because this provides a comprehensive sample that includes asymptomatic cases, those that avoid healthcare or rely on non reported home tests, and may reflect viral loads. This correlation has proven accurate in many many municipalities across the last two years and therefore is increasingly more trusted. Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen. In the US they seem to have peaked and are falling. In this one article the slope seems to be falling really fast. [url] [url] More info about how and why this is done: [url]",

Countrywise, 75% of all adults have received at least one dose and this number is still growing, as the rollout is now focused on young adults (18-25) who werent eligible to get their jab before. While this might seem a vaccine success story, it did not come without its hurdles. Vaccine rollout has been dramatic, to say the least. Bolsonaro is an anti-vaccine apologist and has sabotaged vaccine purchases since they first came. Being the 2nd worst affected country in the world, with over 500k dead, didnt change his heart. In stark contrast to other national leaders on the world, he did not get his jab and does not plan to do so. Skepticism and politicization of vaccines soon struck. We are screwed, I thought. Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US. Young people werent likely to get their jab this year. But somehow, it happened. Despite being disdained by the federal government, vaccines were soon became a representation of hope, soon became something the people needed to fight for if we were to have any chance against this disease. Little by little, Brazilian social media feeds were flooded with pics and videos of people being vaccinated. They put on their best clothes, posting their photos with inspiring takes on the importance of vaccines on Instagram. There is even a joke running here this vaccine only works if you post about it on social media This kind of good and organic peer pressure paid off - upon seeing their friends and relatives getting their jab, most Bolsonaro supporters reluctantly jumped in line to get their jab, even those people would avoid being excluded by their families. Against all odds, we are making it. We dont have many fully vaccinated people yet (just 30% of adult population). Peer pressure and social media work wonders. Close people getting their shot and sharing their experiences work better than some celebrity endorsements and free ice cream.",

My anxiety about that has evaporated, but now Im hyper focused on the possibility that I was exposed to COVID while I was there. Delta is going crazy, and they treat plenty of COVID patients at that hospital just thinking of how many covid positive individuals shared a chair with me in the waiting room or my recliner in the hospital room makes me shudder. Im utterly terrified. I came into close-ish contact with nine hospital employees in that two hours. No interaction lasted more than 15 minutes, most being shorter. Everyone was masked. Ive tried to search for others posts worried about a similar issue, but I havent really found much Im just so scared, guys.

When I first gradutated highschool they elected a conservative government that absolutely hated people on welfare. Every attempt to get ahead in life has been met by systemic issues that seem impossible to overcome. All this time older people and government constantly gaslight my generation. I have been told all my life how spoiled and privileged I supposedly am when I grew up poor with 2 drug addict parents. Right now I am unemployed, I was formerlly a carer and now the government is refusing to pay me anything for a stupid reason. i have to contact a social worker to beg for pittance. I feel no loyalty to a country and society that has made it clear it hates me. What does this have to do with covid you may wonder? Well here young people can't even get a single vaccine. I can't even get AZ in my area, some can. But basically if you are under 30 there are no vaccines available still. They doubled the cost of university courses during this pandemic, when the uni experience is no longer even half as good as it was. I have no motivation to study in that environment and them doubling the cost has pretty much made me think no way. my age group has the lowest employment rate yet we are the most inelligible for government support in this time.

We have planned this for a while and we already had a lot of ongoing work from before COVID. If I drop out now I don't know if they want to do it without me, or might kick me out of the group. However it suddenly turns out one other person, let's call them Person-X, is unvaccinated. Person-X claimed that the vaccine was only available when they were away from home for a week as an excuse. But that is wrong, it's easy to get a vaccine where we live. I already have 2 doses. I didn't say that because I didn't want to start an argument. Person-X has earlier said they did not care about the vaccine so I think this is the true cause. I don't want to spend hours inside a relatively small room with Person-X now because it's not safe enough. I currently value having good health a lot. It's just not worth it to me. :/ I don't want to be rude to the group and let them down after all this planning. Especially as Person-X claimed the vaccine was not available.

Ive disinfected most of anything that would be touched, and Ive also turned on the ceiling fan, AC, and cracked the windows open (I said I would cover the electric bill). What else can I do as a precaution. Is it likely for me to be exposed to the virus anytime I use the kitchen? There are no windows over there or ways to air it out, really: 2. Do I need to self isolate? We both go to the same university and he said student health would reach out to me with info but they have not sent me anything yet. I have no symptoms. 3.

Unfortunately, due to the bungled vaccine rollout in our country as well as the Delta variant that reputation has been destroyed in 2021. We are currently at our absolute worst point since the pandemic started. Today we got 1435 cases, which I know if you're from America or Europe you might roll your eyes at us and think this number is tiny, but to us this is huge and unbelievably demoralising. We're poised to get out of lockdown around October 28th which is when we're predicted to hit 70% double dosed and we'll have more freedoms once we're 80% double dosed. But there is a huge fear of the hospitals being overrun here when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths skyrocketing and having to go back into lockdown even at high vaccination rates. I am feeling so defeated right now, although I am fully vaxxed so its some comfort to be protected. I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire. Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? Thanks.",

We weren't really worried, since she has the best immune system out of all the family members, although she has been badly sick around 4-5 times ever since I'm alive, and I'm 20. To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications. Also, if anybody here had the same symptoms (burning stomach, burning chest or the headache without fever), please feel free to share any tips that helped you or helped someone else you know.

Now I did say the same going into 2021 and while I was locked down for months (Ontarian) it was better on the whole, but the end being just like the beginning has really ruined morale. And the thing is even if this does \"end\" anytime soon (I have a hard time believing it will before 2024) there's gonna be some other disaster, prolly climate related, that's gonna make the next \"era\" feel like hell too. It was the same for most of my life, either something was terrible personally or politically and there was no true peace. So should I just assume things are going to stay like this for a long time and plan my future based on that? I've been putting things \"on hold\", should I just be changing those plans entirely at this point? Please only respond if you have information on any of this, the \"I feel the same way\" comments honestly just make me feel sadder and more worried. I want this to be a discussion on facts and educated hypotheses, not fearmongering (although I feel like I kinda did that in this post) and hyperbole.",

And we had a million cases in 1 day in the USA which I never thought would even be possible. I also spoke to my therapist about it, and she told me that people in the trans community are very covid cautious. And that the reason why a lot of people in that community didn't try returning to normal over the summer was because of a lack of social support from their families. She basically told me that for now I should try a different zoom group to find new friends. And I've tried zoom groups and had pretty bad luck with them in general, and one of the zoom groups I went to criticized me when I said I was thinking of going to Florida for spring break last year, and even after I got vaccinated. And then there's the issue of mask mandates, I have a very hard time seeing how my area will get cases low enough to remove the mask mandate now since they're goal for removing the mandate is currently focused on cases and not hospitalizations.

Now while neither of my bosses have taken this super seriously, my one boss is at least vaccinated. My other boss isnt. He got Covid once before and now was apparently exposed to it at some point last week when he played golf with his uncle (who runs our corporate office one town over). His uncle has Covid-19 fully. Unaware of his vaxx status. Anyway, I found this out through back channels and context clues. My actual two bosses did not disclose this to me.

The one that was exposed is working from home today and the next several. Has anyone else encountered this type of situation and if so what did you do?

What is not at all clear is whether vaccinated asymptomatic people can transmit it. And my best guess is no or not very often. He added: Im not worried about an asymptomatic vaccinated person spreading it to me. Its also important that the country not respond in ways that would do more harm than good say, by delaying the full reopening of schools, Dowdy added.

And I blame the news for that. News always fear monger and that makes people go crazy, sad, scared, and confused. Why, when I was working as a courtesy clerk at Vons, people argue for masks. There was theses two men arguing each other. One is wearing a mask and the other guy is not wearing a mask. The guy not wearing a mask says he believe in science and the other guy wearing mask tells him that he is a selfish a-hole. And the news always makes false information about the vaccines and it's no wonder nobody wants to or too scared to get vaccinated. I was nervous to get vaccinated, but I got vaccinated and it wasn't so bad. Why can't the news be hopeful, for once. Something must be done with the news to end this fear monger if we want to end this pandemic. Sure, the virus will sadly last forever, but they can't let this pandemic last forever. Stupid news!",

My boss, the only doctor in the private healthcare office I work for (all vaccinated, as far as I am aware), tested positive yesterday after feeling ill on Thursday. I was in the office around him often for 8 hours on Wednesday and for two hours on Thursday before he went home, wearing masks the whole time. In addition, the other person working in the office on Wednesday is now feeling ill and is getting tested as well. I am having no symptoms and tested negative using a rapid result test on Sunday, but I know those can throw false negatives, so I got a PCR test today along with my roommates who I could've potentially exposed and am now waiting on the results from that. My boss says if I test negative I should be able to go in from Thursday on (even though the practice will be mostly non-functioning given he's obviously not going in for at least a week), but I don't trust his advice given he's been attending weddings and conferences this summer. Even if I do test negative, because I work in a healthcare setting (non-emergency, I don't want to give the exact profession but in a similar vein to a physical therapist's office) I feel I should quarantine for the full ten asymptomatic days to be certain I'm not going to experience delayed infection, and because I live with immunocompromised and at-risk individuals. Is this an unreasonable ask? He's making me feel unreasonable for being wary at the thought of going in before I've quarantined the full amount; we only have a handful of front desk staff and if even one of us gets sick the others have to pick up the slack. On a more personal note, is there any way y'all have found to deal with the intense guilt of potentially exposing people to Covid?

These are only my feelings at the moment, but I feel like getting them out and having feedback from others would help my COVID recovery, at least mentally. Here it goes. I tested positive for COVID after pretty much my whole family got it. While I only tested positive in the last 16 hours, I have felt off since 8/12. Here is where I'll let you in on my dilemma, and I do not expect pretty much any of you to agree with me. There is a girl that I work with that I think is insanely pretty and cool. I have been gradually getting closer to her over the last few months and I feel like we're really starting to become friends. The problem is, her last day of work is on 8/20 before she goes back to school, and I would really like to stay in contact with her while she is at school. I was planning on asking for her snapchat on 8/20 which is the next and last time I will see her for some time. My COVID diagnosis threw me for a loop I did not expect and if I follow all guidelines I will not be able to see her by the time she leaves for school. This has led to me planning to hide my diagnosis in order to see her and talk to her before she goes away until December. Obviously this puts her and my other coworkers at risk of catching the virus, but I feel like I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't make an effort to talk to her. I know this is immature, and I know that this has an answer that is very obvious to most. I only ask for respectful feedback.

I honestly don't know what I was thinking-- about an hour and a half in, the space got even more crowded and I finally got uncomfortable enough that I decided to leave. I'm ashamed and embarrassed and at a loss with myself. I promise I'm not looking for reassurance here; I know that I made an awful decision, and I want to handle it now as responsibly as possible to avoid infecting anyone in my community. I'm fortunate to be a grad student at a university where we have access to incredibly accurate rapid testing (results in 6-24 hours, generally), and I've decided to self-isolate until I get a negative test result. I canceled several in-person meetings this week, the most important of which being with my thesis advisor who has a 10 year old son. I told him what happened and that I thought we should postpone, and he suggested we met Friday morning, of course pending a negative test result. The new CDC guidelines say that you should get tested 3-5 days after exposure, so my question is, if I test Thursday morning (roughly 4 and 1/2 days after potential exposure) is that long enough to really trust a negative result, or should I wait, push back with my professor, and self-isolate for longer? Could I trust a Friday morning test? Saturday morning? Any advice would be deeply appreciated-- I really appreciate this community and this space.",

In my country of residence, vaccination was very slow, but in my other country of citizenship, vaccines were widely available. I received my first vaccine dose in the country of residence, but the second dose was not to be available for another 3 months. During this period, a close family member in my other country of citizenship became very ill, and I needed to get there immediately. Additionally, in order to be able to see her, because of strict rules, I needed to be fully vaccinated. And so, I took my second vaccine there, and the physician accepted the proof of my first vaccine from my residence country. It was the best decision, because I was able to spend an entire month with my family member, and left feeling at least somewhat less heavy-hearted. The problems is that my residence country will *not* accept my vaccination record from the other country, and so I am officially \"not fully vaccinated.\" What this means is that I cannot be granted the current \"Vaccination Passport\" available to all residents, which allows those fully vaccinated to travel to all other EU countries without quarantine, testing, or other problems. Without this, traveling - which I need to do for my work - will become extremely difficult, often impossible. So I'm thinking of just going to get my \"second\" vaccine here in my country of residence, which is now available, and then the authorities will issue the passport so that I can get on with my life as much as possible. I have read quite a few things from what appear to be reasonable sources online, and it seems that getting a third vaccine within a period of three months wouldn't be harmful - but I obviously want to be very, very careful. Anyone have any solid information/advice one way or the other? Thanks in advance.",

While my parents are normally pretty reasonable, for whatever reason they bought into all the propaganda against the Covid vaccines. While I wanted to get it and was eligible months ago, I wasn't allowed. They seemed so very genuinely worried that it would hurt me, and it was emotionally taxing to keep arguing against them. They wouldn't listen. Since I don't leave the house much, I figured it would be okay to give up. I agreed to wait until FDA approval, then get it. In a case of the worst possible timing ever, though, just as a vaccine receives full approval, there's been an outbreak at my father's workplace. A big one. He tested negative four days ago, and hasn't been to work for unrelated reasons since then, but I'm still scared. I've asked him to mask, isolate, even open a window and he's said no. Every time he coughs within earshot, I want to claw my eyes out. So, while I've finally got a vaccine appointment for 2 days from now, I'm worried it's too late. I'm taking my temperature constantly, checking my breathing, washing my hands like crazy, wiping stuff down... I don't know what else to do. And I keep ruminating over how, if I do get sick, people will think I deserve it since I'm not vaccinated. They'll think I'm just one of the idiots. But I swear I didn't want to be, I really would've gotten it day 1 if I weren't so scared of confrontation. I guess this isn't much more than a vent. Logically I know I'll probably be okay. Even if I get it, I'm 29. A little overweight, out of shape, but no other health issues. But I just needed to say, somewhere, that this isn't entirely my fault. I'm not stupid, just... cowardly.

She recently got mad at me for planning on going too a concert this November in Florida. And economicly work is slowing down a little again because of the delta variant, and I had too move back in with my mom because I had my car broken into twice and totalled 2 times in 4 months. And I really have no hope things will get better, I don't think I'll ever be able too find new close friends again and we're gonna have too wear masks for a very long time again. And in my area people never stopped wearing them when the mandate first got lifted in mid june",

Baby is now 6 months old, and with Delta, weve restricted our bubble to grandparents (also our childcare) only. My office has us on a hybrid WFH model 3 days in office, 2 days remote. Only unvaccinated people are required to wear masks in the office at all times (we had to provide proof of vax cards), but I still mask when moving around the building. Work protocols encourage all digital meetings, but allow in-person conferences with social distancing. So far Ive been able to avoid any in-person meetings, except this one Im required to attend an off-site meeting with members of my office + members of a new agency partner. Its a small gathering at the agencys office 7 people and my team members are vaccinated, but Ill be the only person wearing a mask (the agency said they arent masking in-office. No insight on their office protocols). The meeting will last 2 hours. Not sure how big the conference room is. The agency is providing coffee and breakfast treats (my favorite things) of which I will not partake. I plan to mask the entire time, have as much distance between myself and others as possible, and drive right back home to shower. I guess Im just frustrated by the requirement to attend the meeting in-person AND feeling like Im being overly paranoid. Delta is rampant and I have an infant. Im not going out to do anything fun in general, groceries are delivered, and I resent having to be around people whose vaccine status is unknown to me. I suppose my question isam I worrying too much? Are my feelings justified? Maybe both?",

She's the first one to bring the virus in our house from her school, my parents tested positive last Friday, I've been trying to isolate in my room while wearing a mask when outside my room and avoiding as much contact as possible. Long story short, this morning I woke up with a scratchy throat with some mucus buildup, did a rapid antigen test, showed positive within 10 minutes. I'm both anxious and disappointed at the same time. I know that we have the best protection we can currently get against this virus and that in theory we should be ok however I'm just afraid of brushing off this virus as a minor thing because loads of people have called this virus \"a bad cold\" or \"just the flu\" only to end up in hospitals or way worse you know? I'm disappointed because I build up this image in my head of the vaccine as a COVID shield that makes you really resistant to COVID and that it's super hard to get infected with it. I was even reading a case of a doctor who had the <ORG> vaccine who spent hours next to COVID patients and the doctor never got COVID. Now that I have it I feel extremely let down especially because I did try to take all the precautionary measure I possibly could. In the end I feel like having the vaccine made no difference to our family being infected because we got it anyways. Breakthrough cases are supposed to be 1 in 500, what are the odds of 3 of them in one household? Anyhow, my symptoms are just now starting, I have a very mild fever and my head feels kinda fuzzy but I expect them to get way worse in the coming days so I hope I don't have to be hospitalized that would be quite terrifying.

We're still here, however close we are to losing our minds, and that's something that's so significant. We've fought our minds and won. Plenty of us (absolutely me included) will be having waves of hopelessness and fear that come and go and recede a little then rear up again and smack us one. And that's alright - what we've been through would definitely class as trauma, especially if you've had difficult circumstances, personal encounters with COVID, or supportive interactions cancelled. We shouldn't expect to feel unscathed after all of that. But no matter how hard it gets, try to remember that there's been plenty of positive studies released about the current situation (which yes, we know they have caveats, but their presence is an amazing positive compared to their absence). Also remember that absolutely everything in life is temporary - you won't feel this way forever. (And even if you don't believe it right now, it's still going to be true regardless.) I know this Christmas will be difficult - bad times can be amplified when you feel like you should be feeling good. But if you can, try to step away from the news for a while (all the stories will still be there when you get back) and do something that makes you happy or switch off from the world - eat good food, talk to someone, play a video game, sleep for twelve hours. Don't be afraid to mope or cry or pretend it's not the holidays, either. But either way, you're gonna get through Christmas, and you're gonna get through the next few months of COVID, and then you're gonna get through whatever comes next, and you'll look back and realise you're so far in the future away from your worst moments and it'll feel like no time has passed at all.

It came back as faintly positive, but positive. That night I had the worse headache I ever had and my joints were killing me and a fever. I tested at home again and it was bright pink positive so I went from quarantining in my house to a specific room. 9/7 rolls around and I submit my covid tests to my work. They say this does not count, I have to go to an approved facility. So I find one and go get tested late 9/7. Today 9/8 I receive my results as a negative PCR test. So on record I never had it. My question is did I have it, do I have it, and should I still quarantine. Does one negitive PCR out weight symptoms and two positive Antigens? Or does the 4 days apart between the two tests negate everything? I was positive but since I have the vaccine I quickly got rid of it. My 11yr old daughter who is very sick tested positive on the antigen also and negitive the same day on the PCR. To add to this I do have <ORG> vaccine back in April/May time frame. Not sure if this could effect the results between the the tests.",

We're scheduled for our boosters on Dec 28 (me) and Dec 30 (my parents) and we all either work from home or are retired. I also have school but idk how that will work now. I want to avoid being exposed before then (and maybe for a week or so after) so that I don't get symptoms and have to give up my appointment. So I suggested we go for a nice walk in nature tomorrow instead of the movie, and when we exchange gifts with others outside our household we all wear masks. My parents are planning to go to the movie even if I don't go, so I would still end up getting covid if they picked it up. And my mom is complaining about not wanting to wear a mask with someone in our \"bubble\" (even though my aunt is interacting with her BF and his family as well). I've straight-up told my parents I would resent them if they did end up picking it up (I don't deal with illness well and with the whole having to isolate for over a week thing I know I'd go stir crazy and turn into an absolute monster). Should I isolate in my room as much as possible until I get the booster (it's only a few days)? Or should I just live my life because we're probably going to lock back down here soon anyway?",

Fast forward one co worker has tested positive and now my sister has as well (unrelated to my place of work, she and her roommate caught it from someone over Christmas). Im honestly very nervous and people all around me keep talking about omicron and how all of us are just getting it left and right.

Since then, he has been experiencing chest pain, dizziness, almost lost consciousness a few times, and shortness of breath. Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.",

Since the pandemic started, my ocd has made it impossible for me to be able to feel ok flying to see her or have her come, so the visits have been less frequent. We had plans for her to come over during the holidays but due to omicron we had to postpone the visit and now she is coming in march. I am excited because i miss her so much but i am so anxious that im doing the wrong thing. I live with my mom (57) and grandparents, we are all vaccinated and boostered. My gf is vaxxed and boostered as well. I would pick her up from the airport and drive 3 hours to where we wanna spend 5 days, then we will come back to my house and we can get tested before coming back on day 5. It sounds solid right? i wont be putting anyone at risk, right? i know it might sound stupid but i just feel so anxious and my brain wont just relax. I feel so scared i will bring back anything to my elderly grandparents, it makes me feel selfish.",

I feel like Ive been mostly very lucky with how my family takes Covid seriously, but Im just at my emotional wits end trying to explain something that seems like it should be obvious. Theyre interpreting the numbers in a way that tries to make an incorrect point about how vaccines dont change your chance of surviving Covid once youve been admitted to the hospital. I feel like Im on crazy pills and dont know how to explain it to them in a way that doesnt make me want to pull my hair out. Theyre looking at the rates of hospitalization and deaths in each state, per 100,000, for fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. Theyre looking at data reported by the NYTimes which was updated 3 days ago. So for example, California, where we live, has reported 647 hospitalizations and 58 deaths for unvaccinated people, and 9 hospitalizations and 1 death for vaccinated people. Now, theyre calculating that 58/647= .089, and 1/9= .11, so you have a higher chance of dying in the hospital from Covid if youre vaccinated (instead of realizing that this data really means you are 58X more likely to die of Covid if youre unvaccinated in CA). Basically theyre saying the vaccine doesnt work to help people who are already hospitalized because you have a higher rate of dying in the hospital if youre vaccinated. This data may be *technically* correct, but its missing the context of the fact that the vaccine keeps people out of the hospital in the first place so one person out of nine dying skews the number outrageously. So what do you guys think, how do I explain to them that this interpretation of data is erroneous??",

Masks freak me out because every time I see someone/a group of people/everyone wearing it, I just get reminded of that day, that moment, that guy who assaulted me, over and over again and I have to relive it no matter how much I try not to think about it. I have learned to tolerate my phobia, understand the importance of face masks during this time and not blame people for wearing them at all but I just end up getting more and more frustrated at how long this pandemic has gone on. All these new variants aren't helping my phobia and I don't know how much longer I can handle reliving the worst moment of my life every day.",

Since then, he has been experiencing chest pain, dizziness, almost lost consciousness a few times, and shortness of breath. Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.",

I keep reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is sort of a pointless risk- why risk the side-effects of the booster when it won't even help me? But I also think, are the other/older variants (delta, original Covid) still in circulation? Maybe I should get vaccinated to protect against them? I don't know. I have already taken the first 2 doses of the <ORG> vaccine, and I took my second dose back in July 2021. I had little to no side effects. I was well enough to keep working. But I've always dreaded getting the vaccines because of the possible side-effects. I am a late thirties male in normal health and normal weight. I feel like if I have to risk side effects like myocarditis, it has to be worth it. I work from home and only leave to go shopping, so I feel like my chances of catching covid are relatively low. So my questions are As a late 30s male: * Do I risk side effects of the booster that has low efficiency against omicron? * Or should I wait for the vaccine that is customized to it? * Or should I take the booster because the older more dangerous variants are still circulating?

Since then, shes become pretty sick. I spent quite a bit of time with her on Monday and Tuesday - unmasked. Not only are we co-workers but were also sort of buddies. I immediately tested on Tuesday and came back negative. However, if I was exposed to her on Monday or Tuesday, then it most likely wouldnt show up. I am getting tested again tonight (Thursday). However, I have a flight out tomorrow to visit my parents for the week. My parents are in their early to mid 60s. They are in good health, except my mom isnt vaccinated. I am now faced with this situation where I could potentially test positive here in the next couple of days. I dont want to risk it to my parents but they say they dont care, its worth the risk to them. I told them thats not the point, you may not care but if something happens I will be the one to deal with it. The other thought going through my mind is that I havent seen my mom in forever and I dont want to stay separated from them forever. I would be destroyed if something happened to them and I havent seen them in years. However, I could cause the same thing by traveling. My gut says I shouldnt. Its not worth the risk. But I am also feeling the pressure (particularly from my dad) to come home. I want to so bad and I know statistically speaking nothing drastic is likely to happen but I just want to do the right thing. This on top of the general risk of contracting the virus in the airport. Any advice?",

Despite being vaccinated, people still view getting covid as some kind of moral failing when it really isn't. Covid is a virus that's still circulating worldwide, so testing positive for it isn't something to be totally surprised by. I really dont think there should be a stigma around testing positive for covid in the post-vaccine era. I know that there is always the question of \"what if I get an unvaccinated immunocompromised person sick?\" thats not the same thing as shooting them point blank in the head with a gun, and secondly, theres no reason why immunocompromised people should be walking around completely immune naive against covid, simply being immunocompromised isn't a reason to not get vaccinated, if anything it's a reason **TO** get vaccinated. Anyway, the point of this is to say, just because you test positive for breakthrough covid doesn't mean you're an inherently bad or selfish person. Things happen.",

I finally got a job I love and had to bite the bullet of being in contact with strangers and handling money etc. Until boxing week (its fucking MENTAL during boxing week where I work) I had actually felt very good about rona and felt very confident that I was safe- then I was surrounded by people in an at capacity store for 10+ hours for almost a week straight and got anxious. Fast forward one co worker has tested positive and now my sister has as well (unrelated to my place of work, she and her roommate caught it from someone over Christmas). Im honestly very nervous and people all around me keep talking about omicron and how all of us are just getting it left and right. It feels so close to home and Im worried for my sister (not in an at risk group and is double vaxxed although not boosted yet). I myself am also double vaxxed but not boosted. Anyways, Im rambling but I guess I just needed to vent it out since I have to somehow get sleep tonight before I go back into work tomorrow for the last couple of days before boxing week ends.

I live in the sf bay area which has been frustrating because we're super strict about covid which has made making friends much more difficult. Yet even though we're doing everything right we're still having record breaking cases. Things are getting canceled again just like March 2020. And more people are now less willing to meet new people or even people they already know. Over the summer and fall I tried going to meetup groups to meet new people and I never could really find the right group of people. And now it looks like I'll have to wait till the summer to even be able to try and find new friends again. I spoke to my therapist about my struggles to find people I can connect well with and she told me because I'm not willing to do zoom calls I'm probably not gonna get anywhere towards making new friends for a long time. And one of my closest friends got upset at me for going to EDC Orlando last month and going to Disneyland with my mom last week. I was scared to even post that I went to edc Orlando a month ago because my friend wouldn't approve of it. I still have a super hard time convincing myself that 2022 will be any better. Or that if I lost my life I would be missed by other people. I also fear that people will be even less willing to go back to normal post omicron because of trauma from getting sick with covid.",

Since then, he has been experiencing chest pain, dizziness, almost lost consciousness a few times, and shortness of breath. Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.",

Looking for support or advice So over the past year/2years I've had gnarly allergies and developed chronic nasal congestion, reguring sore/swollen throat, and occasional shortness of breath. Ontop of that I have chronic faituge and since I was a kid Ive had IBS symptoms so occasionally have diarrhea. I feel like every single month I have *some* combination of these symptoms, usually lasting 1-2 weeks per cycle. And am exhausted from all the paranoia around, is it covid?? Do I need to get tested and isolate?? Am I infecting people arlund me?? Do i need to disclose *all* of my symptoms to everyone I meet?? It feels like my body is just falling apart constantly, qnd every time I get tested for covid it comes out negative. (Got tested maybe 7/8 times over the past year. Feels like my body is becoming the Boy Who CrIed Wolf, and then one day if it actuslly is covid, I'm scared Im writing it off as part of the chronic/reccuring ailment. Feels like Im wasting so much time and energy on this when a cycle starts back up. Not sure how to navigate this, and its exhausted being anxious all the time, both being afraid of putting friends at risk, and also not wanting to let me anxiety gdt in the way of social/life activities. I question if I have hypochondria, and at the same time, I do have legitimate symptoms. UGH TLDR: i have chronic allergies, congestion, reccuring throat infections, shortness of breath, diahrrea, chronic fatigue, and I'm living in this state of paranoia/exhaustion every time these things flare up (~1/month).

        "text": "Hi Everyone! I'm having a hard time making a decision and was hoping for some more objective input. The short version is that my partner and I are both fully vaxxed but also both \"high risk\". Before Delta showed up in the US we booked a trip to a Florida beach with our also vaxxed but not high risk friends. At the time I had no concerns about the trip at all. But now I'm looking at the news in Florida and am starting to have concerns about the trip. We'd be going a few weeks after schools opened and it looks like hospitals are already filling. My partner works (fully masked) with the public, so I know we could already catch Delta at any time, but I am worried about catching it a 14 hour drive from home and in a place with very limited medical support. We also have very limited funds and really couldn't afford to extend our stay in the case that we got too sick to make the drive back up. We also really can't afford to have my partner take a week off from work and then take off another 10 days if we ended up exposed. I don't want to disappoint my friends though who already asked weeks ago to promise that we would go on the trip no matter what happened with Delta. I know that isn't a good reason to do something, but I am wondering if I'm being overly cautious and ruining a trip for three people unnecessarily. I know breakthroughs are relatively rare, but I already know half a dozen people at work who had them and their symptoms were way more in line with \"flu\" than \"sniffles\". Again, I know that we still need to live our lives and the vaccines are extremely protective, but since we are high risk, low funds, and would be so far from home, I'm worried about what would happen if we were to get sick down there. Does anyone have any input on if this is relatively safe or a bad idea? The beach itself is more residential and fairly remote from what I can tell. Thank you!",

She does not get help for these issues and makes no effort to work through her behaviors, blaming shitty insurance coverage. She doesn't even see a regular doctor despite the fact that she has multiple chronic disorders that badly need to be treated-- again, this is due to her health anxiety. She also will not get vaccinated. She wants everyone in the house to be vaccinated (which, we are) but says that her anxiety makes her exempt from it. I at first tried being empathetic, had some talks with her about it, and hoped she'd come to a point where she fears COVID more than the vaccine. However, the opposite is true. She scares herself incessantly with medical articles about side effects from the vaccine and worries she'll die if she gets it. She ended up getting COVID after my dad and I got it. The entire time, I was worried she was going to die or be hospitalized due to the state of her health. Thankfully, she's ok, but her anxiety has now consumed her-- it's been weeks since and she will barely leave her room, disinfects everything, etc. She keeps me back from things in life because she wants me to protect her since she's unvaccinated. She won't allow me to see friends or get a new job. I don't see family or anything of the sort either. I'm very miserable and depressed, I love her but the untreated anxiety feels like a burden. I feel fatigued and I can't offer much empathy anymore. At some point her mental health is her responsibility. What can I do to help this situation... if anything? I'm so scared for her health.....",

Regardless, it looks everyone and their grandmas is getting Covid tonight in NYC/DC.. so were just kind of dumbfounded. I have a generalized anxiety disorder so Im pretty sure the worst (and slightly probable) outcome is that my family comes down with some sickness before they fly out. We were planning on just cooking at home and not really seeing any other groups. I plan on staying away from stores and the gym, just go into the office wear everybody is masked and vaccinated at least twice.

Now that I am vaccinated, I would like to know if there are any general rules or ways to decide what things I should or shouldn't do, particularly with the new variants, such as the Omicron variant going around. I am 21 years old and am not in an at-risk group, and I live with mother and grandparents, who got vaccinated with the <ORG> vaccine last year. &amp;#x200B; 1. Can I, for example, play table tennis without me or my coach wearing a mask? I play indoors, it's a small space that is empty most of the time and my coach is vaccinated. But unvaccinated people could walk in the table tennis area any time. 2. Do I still need to wash my hands for 60 seconds every time I receive a package at our house, or would that be overkill? 3. We have a walking area where I live, most people there don't wear masks and I don't know if they are vaccinated, would it be safe for me to go and walk amidst them while wearing a mask? 4. Is it safe for me to go to restaurants? 5. I read that the protection from the vaccine wanes over time. If it is safe for me to go out, assuming that I can't get a booster, how long is it safe before the protection will decrease to the point where I need to stay home, and avoid going out again? 6. Should I isolate everytime I feel feverish or get a fever, or everytime I meet someone, and later find out that they got a fever? 7. Should I be worried about long covid, I read a [post]([url] here about a vaccinated person who got brain fog after getting COVID, should I be worried about this? 8. Are there any general rules or things to keep in mind to help me make these decisions? Like before the vaccine, there were guidelines such as maintaining a distance of six feet and avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands for 20/60 seconds, avoiding being indoors with other people when possible, etc. I'm not sure what precautions I can stop taking and which ones are still very important.

My workplace has undergone a huge transformation, which means that the default model is working from home. You can work in the office for mental health reasons (such as if you live alone). I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room. In 2019, I met a guy, sparks flew between us, and we were going to meet up. He lives in a different country. It has just fizzled out. My self esteem has plummeted as my weight has rocketed. Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office. Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit. Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement. And I'm symptomatic, which has led to me losing my voice so I can't even speak to anyone on the phone. Which is not good as I've been on and off crying since I got back. And my throat is so sore, hurts to cough, hurts to swallow. I'm just at the point where I'm really not coping. TL;DR My life was looking good, then the pandemic transformed my workplace to mostly WFH, home is 1 bed flat, I live alone. Mental health plummeted, now I have covid.",

However, I live outside the service zone of my parents' insurance, and I would be traveling to the Bay from LA when currently omicron is spiking here. Both my partner and I work in schools where a shitton of students and faculty have tested positive or been exposed, specificallytoday. My father has stage 3, almost stage 4 cancer and has been doing weekly radiation and my mother works in-person, so I don't want to expose the household further. Paying to stay anywhere else isn't financially feasible (actually, even traveling up there by bus or plane will almost put me in debt right now) and I don't have anyone to ask in the area to stay with, and also don't want to expose anyone else in case I catch COVID in LA or during travel. (I could literally travel up there, do my appointment, and come back down, but it would be very hard on my body, and I would feel terrible without visiting when I feel like I have limited time left with my dad..)

I was wondering if this sounds... logical given the situation right now, or if I am being too paranoid.

My siblings are also around as well as my nephews and nieces. However as I am on the train home I'm starting to deeply regret my decision. Yesterday we had a big argument because I suggested that we should do those quick self tests just to feel a little bit more safe. They are all vaccinated, but me being only 24 did not have the chance to get it yet (this is Portugal by the way, I know in the US for instance I could already get my vaccine). Anyway, they basically disagree said that they are safe now so they would not have any care, and go out and won't get tested. I've tried to reason explaining that I am still unvaccinated amd therefore at higher risk than them, and would be more comfortable of we still were a bit careful. I am not asking them to get tested every day, I plan to test myself very 4 days or so but would be fine if they did it once a week or so (doing what 2 tests in total while I am there). I'm feeling terrified, they say that I am being selfish for trying to impose some rules, but I am just trying to protect myself, I am absolutely terrified of getting Covid, and have been able to resist all this time and want to continue to do so. What do you advise me to do? What can I do to protect myself from my family? I plan to wear my mask in common spaces even though I know it annoys them, and maybe trying to prepare my food separately when they are not around. Being careful to wash my hands a lot and avoiding close contact with them as often as I can. Is there any crucial thing I should do too or am I forgetting something? Please help me, I am freaking out.",

My workplace has undergone a huge transformation, which means that the default model is working from home. You can work in the office for mental health reasons (such as if you live alone). I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room. In 2019, I met a guy, sparks flew between us, and we were going to meet up. He lives in a different country. It has just fizzled out. My self esteem has plummeted as my weight has rocketed. Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office. Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit. Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement. And I'm symptomatic, which has led to me losing my voice so I can't even speak to anyone on the phone. Which is not good as I've been on and off crying since I got back. And my throat is so sore, hurts to cough, hurts to swallow. I'm just at the point where I'm really not coping. TL;DR My life was looking good, then the pandemic transformed my workplace to mostly WFH, home is 1 bed flat, I live alone. Mental health plummeted, now I have covid.",

My place of work has been hit hard with COVID since I left, so they recommended a place to get a rapid test and hinted that I would be reimbursed for the test if I saved my receipt. Up to this point, my Regional Manager has been very helpful and kind about this situation. This test was $125, which was the most expensive one so far. I knew my work had told me to keep the receipt, so I assumed it would be matched by my work. I tested positive still, so I sent her a picture of the paperwork and she says, \"Cool, we'll reimburse you.\" Seconds later, she texts, \"oops, you actually don't get reimbursed. You got it from your girlfriend and not someone at work. So since you were the first person to bring it in, everyone else gets a free testing since YOU gave it to them.\" How could they blame me, with no concrete proof? How could they think to give everyone else a reimbursement but me? It's almost as if they're punishing me for thinking I was the cause of this! There's no way to prove I brought this infection, in a retail job where we handle up to 100 customers a day?

I know I'm not out of the possible incubation period, but I just feel like I can't be so lucky as to have direct exposure and not get sick this time. Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the vaccine, but it feels like with so many breakthrough cases that I should just expect to get reinfected. I've read booster efficacy sits around 75%. I feel like that should be more reassuring than what my current state of mind has me feeling. I used to feel a sense of comfort, having been vaccinated and having \"hybrid\" immunity, etc, but this surge of Omicron has really crushed that feeling. I know it's milder, which I'm happy about.

I grew up in a multicultural household so for me to be eating food so lacking in flavour (curries are now well and truly out of the question) oddly feels like Im losing part of myself, which is consistent with how many of us are feeling at the moment. Ive been through a lot of major changes over the past 24 months, pandemic notwithstanding, and as someone with depression and anxiety, this may well relate to that.

For a few reasons we are trying to be extra cautious.. 1. 3 kids under 3 will be attending 2. 1 5 month pregnant guest 3. 2 guests actively trying to get pregnant One couple pushed back pretty hard following the reminder. They voiced up it being unfair to expect them test and that it is their right to not share medical information (only thing we asked about was result of COVID test, nothing to do with vaccination). Also, since they live in a more rural town they cited not being able to get tested due to the time it take and availability(I looked into the Walgreens in their town, tons of availability to get a free, drive-up test within a couple miles from their home. This is not something I brought up to them). They also suggested the my wife and myself choose not to attend the event since I am the one who initially shared the request to test (I typically coordinate events). Not everyone in the group is concerned about COVID, but up until now everyone was willing to accommodate the most cautious if it means being able to get together. Between the young kids, pregnant woman, couples trying to get pregnant and some friends who are anxious/nervous about COVID it just made sense to me to ask this of this group. Other than the one couple who voiced against getting tested, nobody has complained even though I am sure a few other people aren't thrilled. I'd love some feedback on the situation.",

I'm tired of getting replies like \"it will be over in the US soon\", or \"can you move to a different state where restrictions are less strict?\". I am not in the US, I am in Southeast Asia where things are really bad here, vaccination rates are low, and most restrictions have not been lifted. I know people are just trying to be helpful, but COVID is a completely different situation in other parts of the world, and it sucks even more to hear that other countries are getting back to normal when your own is still stuck in a mess with no end in sight. I just hope that people can be more conscious of the fact that there exists a whole world outside of America, and everyone's experiences with COVID is different. Maybe don't jump to conclusions that everyone on reddit is from a developed, Western nation with sufficient resources to deal with this virus? Remember that the WHO said this pandemic will not be over until it's over for the whole world. Even if things seem to be looking up in your country, if the virus is still spreading in other countries, it is just a matter of time before it circles back to the US again (just like Delta).",

My friend (fully vaxxed) tested positive for covid a few days later after experiencing very mild symptoms so the rest of us went to get tested as well. We all tested negative with no symptoms! I honestly felt such a relief after this. Not just because I tested negative, but it just truly affirmed for me how well they work. Delta is scary, but had we all not been vaccinated this would have likely been so much worse. We live in a state where Covid hasnt been too bad, and honestly we had relaxed quite a bit, but this definitely was a bit of a reality check but also a major sense of relief at the same time.

During the time that it seemed safe, I planned a surprise dinner for my sisters 23rd birthday, but now Im wondering if I should cancel (cuz the reservations are for indoors, and at this point itll be hard to find anything else). SoI wonder it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are popping) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated? Im young as well (in my mid 20s) and everyone is also around the 23-26 range. All the people I live with are also vaccinated, and same with anyone who would be in our party (tho some of us are still with parents). I do live in an area with high transmission, so l guess Im worried about some random unvaccinated person a couple of tables over coughing and somehow having those droplets reach us.",

I'm so tired, I'm tired of the news, I'm tired of hearing about COVID, I'm tired of being told to worry, I'm tired being told I am a bad/selfish person because I simply just do not care about the case numbers and the deaths. We were told 2 weeks, and it turned into months. We were told vaccines would mark the beginning of the end, yet it just seems that the past is repeating itself. I hate it all. This coming fall semester I am taking a full set of classes. I am meant to go on site but looking at how we are reacting to these variants I doubt it will be anywhere close to a normal semester. If we go hybrid or remote, I will not succeed, I have ASD and I suffered and stressed through my classes in the spring semester to get decent grades, and I only had 3 courses. Not to mention the loss of social gatherings would just make me feel isolated and alone once again. As a psych major, I know that these strong reactions come from the trauma experienced going through lockdown the first time. But it feels like a cycle, it feels like nothing is enough. The vaccine wasn't enough, they said it was, but clearly now it isn't. So when and how does this end? I'm losing hope, and like others on this sub I feel that my youth is being taken from me. I feel cheated, and lied to, by my government, and by society as a whole.",

They are requiring a rapid test negative within 72 hours for all attendees, but I'm not sure if they're requiring vaccination. Masks are required, but because I'm in the coffee industry people will be demoing products and there will be tastings, especially in the workshops I'm teaching. Plus I'll have to take at least two legs of a flight to get there, so crowded airports are a risk, and this is an event that usually has an international audience, so there's the potential to introduce new variants. If people are getting rapid tests before they fly, what about if they pick something up during travel and spread it at the event? &amp;#x200B; I'm vaccinated, but I'm still really scared of catching COVID because I'm a sensory/flavor scientist and losing my sense of taste or smell could kill my career and make my PhD practically worthless for anything I'm interested in doing, and there haven't been enough break-through cases yet to know if permanent loss is a risk with mild vaccinated cases like it was for mild unvaccinated cases. &amp;#x200B; But I'm also on the job market, my current contract ends in January so this was going to be the perfect networking event for me. Furthermore, the organization running the expo funds my lab's research, so backing out is not an option unless they cancel the conference entirely - it would hurt both my own career and the relationship my lab has with the organization. &amp;#x200B; I'm so frustrated by this Delta variant uncertainty. I don't know how much my worry is justified. An acquaintance of mine just hosted a party, all vaccinated, and a few days later 1/3 of the attendees tested positive.

I thought that the restrictions announced yesterday (50% capacity limit with 1000+ people in a venue) wouldn't dent my plans to meetup with family and friends over the holidays, but after hearing the news of more \"circuit-breaker\" measures being considered it just made me think that this is pretty much what we'll have to do in the foreseeable winters, even if we have all the protection in the world from vaccines. Nothing I've done has mattered, I feel like by the time we're truly beyond this, my youth (the years I should have spent meeting people and maybe finding love) will be done and dusted. Sure, I'll get my vaccine and boosters and whatnot, but the powers that be will continue to find ways to ruin everything for me, just as they're doing right now, including forcing online university, online work, and just making my efforts to improve my life utterly in vain.

I feel like my mental health is going down the drain, but I just couldn't stop sometimes. The reason I couldn't stop sometimes is because I have this irrational fear that if I stopped, I'd just be putting my head in the sand and falling into a delusional slumber, and I won't be \"awake\" to the threat on the horizon. The past few days have been rough. There's been so many times I was reading a news article or a Reddit thread and felt tears welling up in my eyes, but could not stop as my irrational mind feared I'd then fall into a delusional slumber. I am literally destroying my mental health for the sake of staying \"awake\". I need to stop. But I'm starting to notice that whenever I'm browsing Reddit, the most reassuring things I see are updates from well-established Twitter experts that do a good job of describing the situation in a balanced manner (e.g. <PERSON> with the vaccination updates and Chise with the Omicron updates). Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health. So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from? Ones that are balanced in their presentation of the facts - not doom and gloom, but not blindly optimistic either. I'll just go to them for my daily Covid updates from now on, and this way I'll stay \"awake\" without all the needless anxiety.",

I'm almost waiting for them to say that they've got 500K+cases per day. It's only getting worse and take this with a grain of salt but I feel like the vaccinations are so slow that there's no way we can beat this until it burns out on its own. Why can't people just listen in the damn first place?! We were so close to the end. So so close. Now, another year with masks, lockdowns all over the world, and avoiding doing pretty much everything except taking a walk from time to time, or going to appointments. I'm so so tired. I lost the first few years of my 20s to this. I lost my sense of taste/smell for 6 months to this ! I lost my appetite and so much of my mental and physical health to this.. I cancelled everything I cared about and stayed almost completely alone for almost TWO YEARS NOW for this! I don't want to sound uncaring, but I want to be selfish too. I want to enjoy something that's not a nature hike or clapping because we got something a little extra in our grocery delivery. Therapy isn't working for this. I don't want to keep coping with \"this is the way it is.\" I'm not even looking for normalcy. I'm looking for a reason to live anymore. To put up with the lockdowns and quarantining for another year. Booster shots possibly every 6-9 months - I just can't! I'm so freaking miserable and I feel like I have so little to be happy about anymore.",

(22F) I started a new job a few months ago in a small office (3-5 people) all whom are fully vaxxd. We dont wear masks but regardless I keep my distance as best as I can. Luckily we all have separate offices as well, however, there are times where we have team meetings at a conference table or so and so will come to my office etc to show me something (not always 6ft apart) Ive let go more with being so anal about things, but still keep my guard up. Long story short: my boss JUST came back from a crowded trip and sounds kinda stuffy and my coworker is traveling for a wedding today into next week. This makes my nerves skyrocket. I can avoid them as best as I can but if I feel more uncomfortable I want to politely voice my concerns politely as to not insult them. (I feel they will reject wearing masks and just stay far away) because last time they both traveled I felt like my concerns were laughed off. My birthday is coming up and I dont want to risk anything and my anxiety is making it hard to focus on work. Any suggestions how to bring this up to them? Possible solutions? Thank you so much!",

For almost 8-9 months my tests were coming back positive, but this time it did not. At the same time there was talk about immunity decreasing overtime, so since I had been vaccinated early on I figured it was because of that. To make sure the tests were not defective I tested my sister, who was vaccinated in late January, shortly after I did, and to my surprise, she was also negative (we both got <ORG>.) I then tested my niece who was vaccinated in June, and to my surprise, she was positive (also <ORG>.) Ater this, I decided to get vaccinated, again. However, Walmart denied me another <ORG> shot, so I went to the CVS, I lied, and told them it was my first shot, and got a <ORG> shot instead. I am feeling guilty for this, and I was nervous, but my god were the side effects intense. My fever was higher than my second <ORG> shot, and I had a swollen lymph node underneath my pit, and I was bed-bound for 48 hours. But today I took the test again, and within 2 mins of starting the test, I got a positive reading. Whatever this third shot did, it seems to have supercharged my immune system. However, I would suggest everyone wait for guidance by the FDA. I am in a very weird spot since I took an unapproved third shot. My electronic record card from the state of California does surprisingly have my third <ORG> shot in my record.",

It was 95% outside and the kids really benefited from the social experience and exercise. We did all sleep inside a rented cabin. It was a great weekend. The day after we got home, one of the immunized adults had a slight cough and tested positive. No idea where they got it. Symptoms lasted about one day, now they're cooped up at home bored, though they've lost their sense of smell. So everyone else got tested and so far everyone (including the kids) is negative (we do intend to test again in a few more days). They said they've had common colds that felt twenty times worse.

I haven't spent longer than one day at home since August, before I started grad school, because of this issue. He's been sick this past week, but I don't know with what. He's never officially had covid before, neither have I or my mom. He actually lied and said he got tested when he really didn't. He claims covid testing \"puts something in your body.\" He even refuses at-home testing. I have tried literally everything to convince him to get vaccinated and tested. Literally every argument I could think of. I simply have no more patience at this point to continue arguing with him. And even though he hasn't gotten sick throughout this whole pandemic, with how transmissible the new variant is, it seems to be pretty inevitable. He works retail, and to add to it all, he's also anti-mask. I didn't go home for Thanksgiving for this reason, and of course my parents were both pissed. Now that Christmas is coming, they're even more angry as you can imagine. Realistically I know I wouldn't be severely ill if I got covid (vaccinated, 21 and healthy) but I'm absolutely terrified of getting a mild case and having it develop into long-haul covid. That's my biggest fear. I'm not sure what to do here. I spent Thanksgiving with a few vaccinated friends, but everyone's with their families for Christmas, and I don't want to be alone. Another option is for my mom to come over to my apartment, without my dad, but at the same time I feel guilty for leaving him alone on Christmas. Am I exaggerating with this?

Double masked, sanitized, the whole bit. Then this week... I researched this place, same size as the other venue. Concert wasn't sold out, looked like plenty of room, good ventilation and the band insisted on masks. The venue ignored the mask rule. Absolutely packed the place. The second band (which was horrible btw) kept encouraging crowd surfing and moshing and it went nuts. But by this time...I've invested 5 hours into this. I think it will be over in a few songs and I don't know that any of these people even want to be around for the actual headliner. But it went on and on. And then the headliner comes on. They are clearly annoyed with the venue but they too encourage \"the energy\" (paraphrasing) and do nothing to stop this. It is stifling, even when I move back from it all.

So, when the virus mutates, is it reasonable to suppose that it might have found ways to transmit through fomites or food?

I've been stuck in what seems like a time loop without an escape for the last 2 years, what I once thought was a bit of time off from the big city life has turned into 2 years of me essentially living like a sloth.

The city I used to work in/from is about 1.2k km away and, although I had sort of adjusted to this small village vibe I feel like it's just not who I am, then again I'm also somewhat afraid I won't be able to go back and live life as I once did without my loved ones around me, but I just don't feel like I belong here. Back in the day I at least had the excuse of having to live so far away because of work, but now I feel like I want to go back just because: it wouldn't be going back as much as trying in a way to move forward.

I don't really like the Canadian governments' handling, and look at Taiwan as the best model for covid (also with a smarter culture) and just wish we could do what Taiwan is doing - they're all walking around freely! In Canada we've been in yo-yo lockdowns for so long, and hospitals are filling up disproportionately with the unvaccinated^(). And I just think to myself, if all you MF would just get vaccinated, perhaps - maybe - we could avoid a lockdown or at least have a shorter one. I used to rant about the government's handling in some skeptical subreddits, but it's full of stupid people claiming that vaccines are deadly and that lockdowns are some global conspiracy to strip us of our rights. *Trust me, our politicians do not care about us enough to hatch a plan like that. There's no money in locking us all down!* It just frustrates me that there seems to be only two extreme sides: Those who think everyone is out to get them, and those who are to get everyone. Come on people, follow the science. Get vaccinated! Demand better testing, tracing and tacking! Call for local lockdowns to happen sooner to stop covid spread in its infancy. Insist on quarantines for travellers and the positive to be mandatory (and cheap/free). At this rate I'm gonna learn Mandarin and move to Taiwan &lt;\\_&lt; ^() [^([url]",

        "text": "My SO tested positive for COVID on Christmas Day. We were in LA together for a week prior to that and I am NOT sick at all. I think he may have been exposed before the trip (between 12/9-12/13). Some of the people he was working with tested positive while we were on our trip. Does that timeline sound about right for him to start experiencing symptoms starting 12/24? He woke up Christmas Eve and felt awful full on symptoms of what I thought to be the flu but with a negative COVID test. The next day, he tested twice both with super faint positive lines. 12/26, the positive line was darker. The only other time he would have been exposed was 12/22 when he was with someone that texted and told him they tested positive. But Im not sure if the onset of the symptoms would have happened that quickly. I guess my real question here is: Has anyone gotten COVID (tested positive and everything) and then gotten a negative test within a few days? Also, has anyone experience getting a false positive test OR anyone know if you can test positive even if its just the flu? I took a test and was negative and am feeling fine. I was sure it was just the flu because I am vaccinated against it and hes not. Lastly, and I know this is a dumb question so dont attack me How soon after he tests negative can I go see him? Were both kind of hoping/holding out for him to be negative by NYE. Super selfish, again, dont attack me. Its just wishful thinking and Im just trying to understand a timeline and hear other peoples experiences. Im curious to know if anyone has gotten over it in a shorter amount of time than others. Hes healthy otherwise and vaccinated (which I know means little at this point). Once he tests negative (even if before the recommended 10 days), if I go see him, is there still a huge risk? \\*\\*His symptoms as of now are: on and off fever, fatigue, GI upset (he threw up once and has had weird stomach stuff sometimes otherwise), stuffy nose (new), cough with green phlegm (getting better), headache, body aches he actually looks and sounds good for being sick. No loss of smell/taste, good appetite, breathing is fine (and no chest pain).",

That said, the new Omicron variant is making its way through the staff of about 6 we have on site. A lot of my co-workers are now out for 2 weeks, and I find myself with all the overtime I could ever want. And just in time, too, because the holiday bills are catching up. 4 of the 6 employees have it, leaving just myself and one night-shift guy. The two of us are the only ones that have been vaccinated. My wife woke up this morning with a headache and fever. Her fever was only 99.8 (just under 100 degrees F). My stepson, a 20-year-old all-knowing anti-vaxxer himself, also had a fever. His was 103, a bit more severe. They both went to get tested, and are both positive. This means I likely have it, or am a carrier. I just took my own temperature, it's 99.2, so yeah - I probably was infected. My question - looking at all of this well-needed overtime, and considering that the entire staff has already been exposed, should I go home and let my manager figure out how to cover these shifts? My vaccination status tells me my symptoms will not be severe, and that seems to be the case so far. I really need the money, and nobody else is likely to get sick except the night-shift guy. Would YOU call your manager, let him know, and give up all that sweet, sweet overtime pay?",

In fact, my favorite con announced they're returning in January and I'm hoping to go. However, a con called megaplex just took place, and immediately after accounts of catching covid started pouring in, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated (because of delta). Conventions are infamous for spreading illness even before covid, so there's a real scare here. Now I'm seeing takes that absolutely zero conventions should take place in any capacity, and more specifically that it's better for them to go under than to think about reopening. As if it's easy for an organization low on money to just run a convention again.

My fear is that the unvaccinated will drive a huge surge and the province will go full lockdown mode as a reactionary measure.

I dont know how to stop my spiral thinking. Ive tried to avoid all news and case counts but its inescapable.

Were socially distanced. Yesterday I woke up with a killer sore throat, I went to gettested results were negative. Today I wake up with no sore throat but gradually started sneezing so I thought might as well take another test so I got an at home test. Clearly negative on the test. I dont know what Im doing at this point and I dont know how to handle this logically. I booked a PCR test for Friday night, Im thinking by then it would show on a home test if Im really positive. Im 26 years old and yes havw both shots so I thought I wouldnt need to worry about breakthrough infections but Im seeing more and more of it. At work people are coughing and sneezing around me. We all wear masks but Im wondering how many people are walking around thinking they have allergies when its covid. This is a special type of hell.

With cases rising and hospitals being overrun, I explained they should implement a vaccine-only rule for guests, with proof of vaccination sent beforehand and rapid tests at the door. I got pushback because they \"can't\" tell people they can only attend if they're vaccinated. I told them they can since it's their wedding. Their plan is to have \"spaced seating\" and \"strongly suggest\" that people be vaccinated and have everyone wear masks. If there's anything this pandemic has taught us, it is that people will lie and do whatever they want to. Of course the proof can be faked, but it's still better than nothing. Furthermore, it's unrealistic to expect everyone to keep masks on the whole time at a wedding where people will be eating, drinking, dancing, having conversations, taking pictures, and trying to hear each other over music. They're the ones choosing to go through with an indoor wedding during a pandemic, but I'm being treated as if I'm completely unreasonable. It seems extremely irresponsible to me. Having a bunch of people attend an indoor wedding and then fly back to their respective homes. I'm vaccinated but I would still very much prefer to not catch this virus, minimal symptoms or not.

Im double vaxxed and got my booster last week, but Im not a healthy woman. (76lbs underweight and anemic) When I get sick, I get *siiiick*.

Last year, nothing was on the up, everything was negative, over 4k deaths per day, everything shut down, outdoor mask mandates everywhere, barely any people vaccinated, and so on. Now, this winter is better because we do not have most of last years craziness. Omicron is shit but remember, the vaccines still work well against it, and more people are getting vaccinated daily. By February or March, the situation will hopefully get better, and we will see the same discussions that we had last Feb/March/April/May. It will get better very soon, I can guarantee that. For those who are asking, at one point, governments will notice that restrictions and mask mandates are counterproductive for the vaccination effort, and that in future pandemics, governments will find a lot of anti-vaxxers who have rejected the vaccine because of the restrictions that the government is levying on the vaccinated, so to avoid this scenario, governments will lift these restrictions sooner than later.",

This Christmas I got my booster and my whole family was not sick and fully vaccinated, save for the small children. Yesterday though I got a distressing text from my aunt, saying that one of the kids came back positive from a pcr test from a week ago. Apparently his dad lied that the negative result from the day before we gathered was from a pcr, and actually came from a rapid home test. (Can I add that I hate how inconsistent and unreliable all these tests seem to be?) The kid apparently had some mild symptoms about a week before christmas and promptly got tested, and the doctor didn't think it was covid. Nobody informed us about this. If I had known I wouldn't have taken the chance What's worse, I went to the gathering with some family friends, and they're much more concerned about this, so they wanted everyone to test negative in some capacity. I did with a home test, but that was only a day after the (at the time unaware) exposure. And I feel so guilty and don't know what to say And what's WORSE worse, is I have both a small new years eve hangout at a friend's house and a convention coming up very shortly. I'm trying to find a pcr test, but everywhere is booked solid. I don't have any symptoms, but I'm so devastated. I can miss out on the hangout, but the convention we've pouted a lot of money and planning into. I have no idea where to even go from here",

I (24 F, 3X vaxxed) went a family gathering on 12/24 (my first family event since COVID began), started feeling sick on 12/26. By 12/27 I had a full-blown sore throat, fever, chills, &amp; difficulty breathing. Standing to do dishes became impossible.

At this point, my symptoms change every day - today is headache, trouble breathing, runny nose, etc. I've had pretty much every symptom except loss of taste or smell. Testing kits are non-existent where I live at this point. Earliest testing appt. was 12/29 for a PCR test through Project Baseline (Rite-Aid) &amp; I received my results this evening - negative for COVID. At first I was relieved, but I'm having a hard time believing that what I'm experiencing is anything but COVID when A) I was in an environment where somebody was clearly infectious &amp; in close contact with family, &amp; B) I've never felt an illness quite like this in my life. Seriously, everything feels like an effort! I've never quite struggled to breathe like this (Also, negative for flu) The earliest testing appointment anywhere near me is 1/6. I intend on testing again but have little hope for answers, honestly, thinking this is pretty far out from exposure date. How should I interpret this negative result?

        "text": "Hey all. Looking for some support or advice/just wanting to vent. My family has faired fairly well throughout this pandemic, navigating it with little difficulty. I'd worked from home since long before the world went remote and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 year old since her birth. We're very much homebodies, so the lockdowns and such weren't a huge departure from the life we'd been leading prior. That's all changed with the school year quickly approaching. We'd initially planned on sending our daughter to Pre-K last year but opted not to because of our concerns about the virus. With an October birthday she's going to be one of the older kids in class this year and she is severely overdue for the type of social interaction that school provides. Anyway, sending unvaccinated kids back to school with the more transmissible Delta Variant being prevalent seems like a recipe for disaster to me. However, I don't think my kid can afford to be isolated another year. We're in a city where Pre-K is provided through the public school system on a first come first serve basis, so, pulling her and reenrolling her later in the semester once vaccinations are available for children under 12 isn't an option. On the plus side, masks are required but its a full-day class, so the kids have to remove those for breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm just at a loss for what to do and it disgusts me that we're still in this situation. At this point, my daughter would be absolutely heartbroken if we pulled her out of school but I'd much rather her heartbroken than suffer any longterm effects (or severe effects) of COVID. I'm sure there are plenty of parents out here dealing with the same and I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

I am very pro-vaccine in every sense, but I think the misinformation being spread, and the side effects being put on blast from the Covid-19 vaccine are scaring me a bit. I've always had pretty substantial health anxiety; I actually had a bit of a breakdown in March of 2020 (quit my job and everything). I live in a very rural, Republican area, and everyone around me is constantly bashing the vaccine and spreading HUGE amounts of scary and sometimes false information. I have not been vaccinated for Covid-19, but I'm very much on the fence. I'd say a solid 60% want to get the vax and 40% of me is terrified of it. On one hand, I'm scared to get vaccinated, but on the other, I'm absolutely petrified of getting Covid. I'm so scared of the rare but possible side effects of the vaccine, but of course, I'm more scared of the long-term side effects of actually contracting Covid-19. I've heard all sorts of side effects from the vaccine, like myocarditis and pericarditis, blood clots, heavier menstruation, and it all just really scares me. I think what I'm searching for in particular are words of wisdom from all walks of life. Whether you got vaccinated right away with no second thought, whether you were on the fence like me, or even if you were 100% against it and got it anyway.

We're both fully vaccinated and Paris (where we'd spend most of our time) seems to be doing well with vaccination rates and requiring vaccines to do most activities. However, we planned this trip in mid-June when things seemed like they were getting better-- now, with Delta, it's feeling a bit riskier to attempt international travel. My question is, which factors would you weigh the heaviest if you were thinking about traveling? Right now the thing I'm most worried about is getting a positive test before returning to the US and having to quarantine in Paris-- that would be a whole mess. But I don't know if that's reason enough to cancel the whole trip, and after a year and a half of being stuck at home, I desperately want to go.

I'm worried because she also is immunocompromised in addition to being in surgery recovery. &amp;#x200B; Then there's my situation. I can't really effectively quarantine, and we're in a small space. I suppose I just have to hope I don't get it somehow. &amp;#x200B; Are there any small things I can do, supplements, vitamins, OTCs that can safely help her recover?",

He was over-weight (not obese), diabetic, and has had asthma most of his life. His underlying health conditions placed him at higher risk for complications and I am sure that he was aware of this and yet, he did not get the vaccine. I was floored when I learned that he was unvaccinated because to me it was a no-brainer type decision. The last time we spoke I asked if he was vaccinated and he said \"I wish had.\" He was happier and more hopeful in the last two years than he has ever been and was engaged with a wedding date in the spring of 2022. He made his last car payment on the same day that he tested positive. He always came across as so intelligent and confident. However, after getting sick and fearing that he was going to die, sounded so scared and defeated. Last weekend he crashed and was placed on a vent. He continued to crash, went into multi-organ failure, began to bleed out, and became septic. At that point I knew that if he survived that he would be in such horrible condition that he would have no quality of life. I am relieved, given the circumstances, that he died. But he suffered so much over the last 34 days that I would not wish it on anyone. If you have something to live for get vaccinated! Trusting your immune system or thinking that you can get through it is foolish. Don't throw everything that you love away.",

We're in a room that's probably about 80sqft, so a small and windowless space. We're both always masked(me with a kn95, her a surgical mask) and vaxxed(I'm also boosted). The reason it's possible is that she had a cold over the winter break that she could never get tested for, but might have been covid and that showed on the PCR. Her rapid test for re-entering school on Monday was negative. She's supposed to take another rapid test on Saturday, so we'll see how that goes. I'm not especially worried for myself. I'm triple vaxxed, 31, and healthy. My dilemma comes from living with my 70 year old mother and 66 year old, diabetic father. They're also triple vaxxed, and my dad's diabetes is actually pretty controlled, but obviously I want to protect them. Aside from masking around the house, and staying confined to my room as much as possible, is there anything I can do? In addition, because I'm triple vaxxed, currently negative, and asymptomatic, I'm still going into work, where I'm masked and staying inside our office, unless asked to cover a class because they're very short-staffed, unfortunately. Anything I can do to keep the kids safe? Any extra precautions I should take? I know the CDC doesn't recommend quarantine, just masking, is that.... fine?

Im 21 and have already had COVID a few months ago. My whole family are vaccinated but I just really really am wary about it. Im not a conspiracy nut, Im a left wing socialist student who is usually on the \"left\" for many many issues. The two things about this vaccine that gets me is that there have been no long term trials and the censorship coming from the pharmaceuticals . Firstly, my anxiety about the long term trials comes from all the previous drugs that failed on mass as a result of improper testing (thalidomide for example). Secondly, I *really* dont like that the pharmaceutical companies that made the vaccines included no liability clauses in their contracts w/ the gov, and they have made BILLIONS- why would they want to admit the vaccine didnt work even if we saw hundreds of adverse reactions? I feel like there is no transparency and I just dont trust them to let us know if it does go wrong. Ive always been wary of big business and this is the first thing I thought when the vaccine was created last year and I just havent been able to think differently on this issue Thats literally all I think. I agree that we should all be vaccinated. I want to be vaccinated but these two doubts are stopping me. Have any of you overcome your fears? Does anyone have any info that will me less anxious?

Now, we don't go to these events often, but I always thought it was in our best interest to mask up at these things. Especially since the infection rate in our state is a bit high. I don't expect people to mask up one on one or in manageable groups. But I guess, whenever I'm in a large group setting, I'm always surprised and anxious when I see so many unmasked faces. And I get it, after being told we could take them off after being vaccinated, its soul crushing to hear its 'strongly suggested' we wear masks again due to Delta. But I'm still so surprised when I see a majority of people maskless. Just curious what the community's thoughts on this are.",

I'm not sure if what I said got through to her, or if she's doing it to keep her job now, but either way I'm happy. I did end up making a page for her, and I went down the line of articles she sent me pointing out the faults of what some of these antivaxxers were saying (it was easy to find that these people were only out for money). I also showed her the nursing reddit and I think that shocked her a bit maybe? So I'm really happy about that, and I hope she'll be healthy as she gets her 1st and 2nd shot. I keep reading stories of teachers literally dying from this strain, and it worries me that she might not make it until the first jab. :( I'm honestly hoping that our governor makes school online for the time being. Oregon hospitals are being filled up right now, and last I read the ones in Portland are renting morgue trucks for the bodies... Aside from that, my life has been a rollercoaster on a personal level. I got my fiance visa to get married in the UK to be with my partner, but our plans for him to come help me have been thrown out the window (due to UK visitors not being allowed entry into the US), and now I have to do everything on my own. It's super daunting. It's such a strange time right now. Good news that seems to somehow bring around worry just as well. I always try to look on the bright side of things, so even if I have to move everything out on my own, then it's one more challenge on myself to improve! And in the end it's a start of a new life! Each hurdle makes you stronger, and I need it for my future plans so I can succeed. :)",

Inconsistent schedules. Losing friends. Friends using cancel culture and saying I haven't known you. Even I've been trying to get in contact with a girl who went to school with me, graduated in 2020 during Covid. For two years I've wanted to see her. We eventually texted a bit, but then her lack of communication and respect of autism caused issues. She visited the school again, and I was going to see her, but again lack of communication. We talked later that night and she said \"I said hi to the teachers, I roamed\" and I got very frustrated. And since then, I wanted to meet that girl. I just wrote letters and shit, and it's not doing a thing. It's making me think that I should've met her in the past, where she would've been more nice rather than have her watch me kill myself in a global pandemic. I just wish we talked properly. That's all. She thinks there's no COVID in her eyes. Oh speaking of that, a dysfunctional family and other environments. On some days everything would be good, some days would be shit.

Nothing severe so far, just congestion and a cough, for the most part. I have asked them about other symptoms and other than some difficulty smelling due to the fact that their nose is stuffed up, there's nothing else to report. They're recently boosted. I'm almost five months out from my second dose, so it's nearly my turn to get boosted too. I have congestion here and there, but mostly I'm just aching and exhausted, and I kept getting headaches on and off, though they seem to have stopped for now. I work from home, but it's been almost impossible to get anything done in the past few days because I'm just so tired all the time. I know we can write this off as something non-COVID, but I'm trying to be realistic here and someone at my family member's job is out with a confirmed case. They were definitely exposed, at the very least. Getting tested is next to impossible, though I'm looking. When I heard the news about how contagious omicron is, I kind of just... accepted the reality that getting it was a definite possibility, even as a vaccinated person. But now that it's looking really likely, especially when I'm reading that experts are saying to assume COVID before you assume the flu or a cold... I'm pretty scared. I tried to get boosted, but until a few days ago, it was too early. I'm trying to stay away from places like the subreddit where people discuss their confirmed cases exclusively. It's a great resource but at this point it's just going to scare the shit out of me, as it's more likely to attract people with more notable (aka, more symptomatic) cases.",

        "text": "When people say we are looking at a new normal (masks, airline restrictions and testing mandates, occasional shut downs of retail and restaurants due to outbreaks), my instinct is that the world is eventually going to just want to move on when it becomes endemic. How could it not? The one thing that worries me though is we know that the largest business interests can completely control policy due to their influence on politicians. Regardless of where they are in the political spectrum - right, left or center. So it's safe to say that the oil lobby will want to return to normalcy and they wield a lot of power. They want travel to come back, people to get into their cars and go places, and the manufacturing economy to start chugging along at full speed. Then you have the entities that actually benefit hugely in this pandemic phase: companies like amazon that have obliterated retail and keeping people out of malls only helps their business. Pharma companies that are rolling in cash not just for vaccines but for anything people want to take that they think might help them. I'm sure there are many others. When things go back to normal, amazon is going to see their record profits return to normal. So isn't the question - who has more power, the ones benefiting from this new normal, or those that want it to return to previous times?",

Ive had a few close contacts/exposures over last week and this week, the most recent one being Monday. I have a 6 month old baby so just for piece of mind really, I tested every day since. On Thursday morning I tested using an On/Go rapid test and it came back positive but with a really faint line, faint enough that I had to shine my light on it to see it. Trying not to panic, I wanted to be extra sure so I worked (from home) waited 8 hours and then took the other test out of that same box. This time, the positive line showed up a little more visible but at about minute 7 I noticed that the line was half gone. And by minute 10 it had completely disappeared. Confused and anxious, I took a different brand test (Quidel Quick View) and that came back negative after the ten minutes. I was feeling a little manic that day from all of the confusion and ended up digging that test out of the trash after about an hour and it looked like there was a positive line there, but it wasnt there the first time. Friday morning I tested negative and also Saturday I tested negative. Throughout this whole time I never had any symptoms except for a baseline morning headache and a bit of a dry throat that tends to go away by mid morning. I am currently waiting on PCR results to come back but they wont be here til Monday. What are your thoughts? Has anyone experienced this? Thanks in advance!!",

I feel like its only a matter of time until mask mandates are in my town again for everything and its really making me spiral. I got the vaccine and had no problem with it, but it feels like it doesnt even matter at this point. If an entire campus that is vaccinated, surrounded by a community with high vaccinations, isnt safe then what would ever be safe?! Im deeply worried that masks are just a permanent part of life now in public, at least in my area. Ive voiced my concerns with some people and I just get shot down with its just a piece of cloth, its no big deal, itll just be temporary, etc. Maybe Im crazy but masks are worst part of the pandemic for me. I wore them where required this whole time, but wearing them and even seeing them really negatively effects my mental health. I feel like Im trapped in a dystopian movie and cant escape. A constant reminder to be afraid, that this isnt safe. I just hate how these concerns are always just swept aside as being whining or whatever. I just dont see how masks wont become permanent given the current logic of the mandates (vaccinated people can still spread). Can someone just give me some copium that these mandates will be over quickly? Like if the Delta wave ends, can I take the mask off? As crazy as it sounds, the new mask mandates are scarier to me than the Delta wave itself, but I feel like Im the only one who is upset about it.",

Now a few things I should point out; * He wears a mask and requires all clients wear one as well, even though his mask is a weird, hand-made tripple-filter carbon filter/ cotton/ silk thing. * He just got his booster mid-November and requires all clients to be vaccinated and postpone sessions if they have traveled on a flight. * I don't want to jinx anything but for 70 he seems very healthy. He's always outside lugging stones and wood around the yard and doesn't have any other health issues that I know of. I just lost my mom and I don't think I could go on if I lost him now.

But still, I fear the inevitable FOMO if my university goes remote for the entire spring semester, while my friends at other universities are still in person. My university wont announce anything until early January as per the update last week, but still what if they say theyll return to in person like after two weeks then extend online learning right after tuition is due? I know alot of people at my university and other ones fear this possibility. More and more universities in the US and Canada are going remote for at least the start of their spring semesters, but theres a growing fear that the entire spring semester goes virtual. Its a tough decision for sure. Do I transfer to avoid a potential remote semester for the sake of my mental health but leave behind all my friends, or do I stay where Im at and be with my friends but at the risk of a remote semester?",

I live with my parents, one of whom has had historic lung issues, is 71, and also probably high risk. We're all fully vaccinated. My goal, really, throughout all this is to reduce my chance of *infection* to near zero. It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid. I know being vaccinated my chances of hospitalization and death are low, that's not really what I'm worried about. I'm a wind player, and theoretically have an orchestra concert coming up mid september. I'm in Oregon where cases are pretty out of control. From what research I've seen, playing a wind instrument is essentially identical to just talking in terms of risk factor. So that's fine. Assuming no precautions are taken, that'll be something like 20 people within 15 feet of me, possibly unvaccinated, unmasked, not particularly well ventilated space, for multiple hours. To me that is very clearly an untenable risk, even though I am vaccinated. I guess the first gut check - am I already being over-cautious in thinking that? If I'm right that that is way too risky. What precautions would be reasonable to ask for? If everyone is vaccinated, all non-wind players are masked, and I'm 6 feet away from everyone else, that's about as many mitigating factors as possible - and I honestly can't tell if that's enough to be safe or not. It's still being unmasked in a room full of people for hours, doing an activity that for me involves a lot of deep breaths. I suspect, on one hand, I may be too cautious in thinking those measures wouldn't be enough? and the other hand I can't help but shake the fear that it won't work out okay",

Recently, with the Omicron surge, a few of my coworkers have tested positive. Its a small retail store with two departments and we are required to wear mask. We share common areas such as a break room and bathrooms. Over the past month theres been a few times Ive wondered if I was positive but always come back negative on a rapid + 1 PCR. Yesterday I experienced a bad headache that went away with Advil and a slight runny nose. This morning I woke up with a bad headache that eventually mostly went awaybut terrible diarrhea. Its still the afternoon and Ive gone 7-8 times. My stomach feels fine, no fever, and negative on a rapid. Its just such a struggle to know if Im actually positive or if my mind is just making me feel this way. The strange thing is, and please dont judge me for this, Im not afraid of getting COVID. Ive accepted that I will probably have it at some point and can only hope for the best and take precautions. Hoping someone has some words of advice.",

I had to tell my workplace and my boyfriend that somebody got sick again, I just kept thinking how we need to adjust all at home to take care of my brother and I felt extremely guilty for going out to work or seeing my boyfriend when my brother still didn't show signs of COVID. I just went up to my room and cried a little bit trying to control my anxiety, and then I just went on with all the things we needed to do to take care of my brother. I had anxiety long before COVID, so sometimes there are days I really struggle with.

My covid anxiety was finally gone in 2021 (I'm in Canada, we got our numbers so low) and now it's back full force to the point that I have a panic attack every day. My parents are anti-vax and are friends with even more severe militant anti-vaxers who are also conspiracy theorists. I am an adult who lives alone apart from them. My mom has had two vaccines and my dad is unvaccinated. I've had nightmares and anxiety attacks about my dad dying from covid since the beginning of the pandemic. He refuses to get vaccinated no matter what I say, how I beg or how I plead. On new years, my parents partied with their antivax friends. Last night I had yet another nightmare in light of omicron. Today my dad tested positive. I have not been able to calm down. I've been crying, panicking, the whole nine yards. Nothing I Google regarding an unvaccinated person's chances against the virus is comforting. I'm terrified my dad is going to die. I'm not ready to lose my dad. I just lost my uncle to cancer a month ago. My dad is 60 years old and he's very healthy and fit for his age, but I'm still worried because of his age. Currently he has no symptoms and my mom keeps telling me I'm being alarmist and ridiculous for freaking out so much but I keep panicking about my dad suddenly dying in his sleep or it suddenly turning worse really fast. Additionally, my parents were likely exposed on Dec 30-31 and on Jan 2 my mom insisted on dropping off a bag of food at my place. She's fully vaxxed and I had her stand outside (open doorway) to hand me off the bag, she wore a mask and I wore two masks (I'm triple vaxxed) and yet I'm still absolutely petrified ill develop symptoms at any moment. Literally any words of comfort or something could help rn, all my friends say is \"I'm sorry\" like my dad is already dead and I freak out even more.",

I don't have any symptoms other than the occasional skipped heart beat, but reading through some of the cardiac side effects people have experienced and seeing stories of myocarditis/pericarditis has really made my anxious. However, I'm also terrified of catching COVID and dealing with potential side effects or long-term effects from that as well. My state and city are a current Delta hot-spot and I don't see it getting much better in the near future. Unfortunately, I moved earlier this year and finding a primary care doctor has been a nightmare. The fastest I can see one is the end of this month, but I don't know if I should wait that long. I feel this immense guilt on me every day that I didn't get vaccinated sooner, or try and see a doctor sooner, and I just would love any and all advice you all might have for me. Thanks!",

Researchers here showed that countries with higher vaccination rates generated FEWER mutations, suggesting less of a chance for the virus to gain virulent mutations in high vaccinated countries. Researchers found vaccination coverage rate was inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 16 countries of 20 countries studied and discovered Delta variants evolved differently under the positive selection pressure in the United Kingdom and India.

He said that he is feeling better, and by the time we leave for the trip, which is this Thursday it will be 10 days he's been in isolation and according to the CDC, he should be cleared to resocialize and therefore not miss the trip. I know there are a lot of factors and it's hard to determine when it might be safe to be around others, but that time frame still seems very tight.

That seems to have passed, but my nose is stuffy, my eyes are burning, I ache all over, to touch my skin hurts, I am nauseous, and have a headache. I've taken Tylenol, but does anyone have any other tips for getting over the hump? I am trying to WFH today, but everything hurts and I just want to lie down and not move. In spite of that, I am happy to have been able to get a booster, which are in pretty tight supply at the moment. I am especially glad to be boosted because omnicron variant is all around me. I bailed on our family dinner on Christmas because the original plan was for 18 people and Public Health had just mandated no gatherings of more than 10 people. I pulled out my family of 5 and they were still planning on going ahead with an illegal number of attendees, 13, and everyone was pushing us to attend. I held firm and I am glad I did, because the dinner was cancelled last minute when the hosts were made aware they were close contacts of a known infection. Having been exposed, they are now quite ill. I am so ready for Covid to be in the past...",

The UK has implemented something similar recently. I'm thinking of requiring people who test positive to isolate for 5 days, get an antigen test on the 5th day, and leave isolation if the test comes back negative (still masked up until the 10th day), but I'm worried about false positives from antigen testing.

Immediately upon finding this out i took a rapid test and it was negative, and then today i took a PCR and am waiting for results. My mother with whom i'm staying with is severely immunocompromised (like had open heart surgery a year ago and one of her lungs doesnt work properly). So despite having been in in very close contact with her i am now distancing from her and everyone else in the house and wearing a mask. Then, today we discovered that a family member who was here on the 1st just tested positive on a rapid test today. So, i have a couple of questions cause we're all kind of freaking out right now. 1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)? 2) It is even possible for me to have transmitted covid to this family member who was here on the first? If i was carrying it, my time of contact with the virus would have been only 4 days prior. Is this enough time for me to have then transmitted it to someone else? 3) What exactly is safe to do in my house? Right now i am confining myself to either my bedroom (mask off) or in an adjacent bonus room (with a mask on). This room is fairly large, and a couple of people in the house pass through it a few times a day, generally passing about 15-20 feet away from me. How likely is it that i can pass the virus to them while being in this room, with a mask on? Thanks, appreciate any help i can get. Note: everyone in my family has 2 vaccines, my mother has had 3. Exactly how at risk of hospitalization/death is she? We're all deeply concerned.",

        "text": "I'm living in the Netherlands and we're in full lockdown once again. I'm constantly trying to make sense why we're one of the only countries in full lockdown, and it seems at least partially due to our low ICU (critical care) capacity, meaning the potential for our hospitals to become overwhelmed is far higher than in other countries. Now, I've clung to the hope that pandemics in the end will end once enough people have contracted the virus / become vaccinated, but the following article worries me a bit: [[url] It says that getting the viruss reproductive number down to one is just the bare minimum for earning the endemic classification (instead of a pandemic), and the moment it stops being a threat will differ per country and depends on factors like hospital / ICU capacity. So since we had kind of a healthcare crisis even before the pandemic, I'm very worried that we might be stuck with restrictions way longer than other countries. Even before covid, in 2018 we had to postpone some operations due to a heavy flu season. The government planning \"long term strategies\" where we will indefinitely move large gatherings to the summer and \"stay low\" during the winter doesn't help either... Can anyone give some reassurance / thoughts? TLDR; I'm worried the problem with limited critical care in the Netherlands will keep us from moving beyond this crisis",

Not knowing if I would have to give birth alone or the hospital would take away my baby. We were in strict lockdown up until my husband and I could be vaccinated. We didn't go inside anywhere. I cried every day last winter. My son is very social and loves people and I couldn't give that to him. He would smile ear to ear at doctor appointments because he could finally see someone that wasn't my husband or me. Over the summer we started doing thing again, it was great. My son was so happy. We did something every day. We would walk around stores, grocery shop, eat out, and go to swim lessons. But it August with delta we started to self lock down again. Back to crying every day and trying to entertain a social toddler. Fast forward to the news that vaccines are actually a long ways away. I lost it mentally. Went full \"fuck it\" mode. Even with the massive surge going on right now. I started doing things again. Going to malls just to walk around with my son, going out to eat, and meeting with friends and family even if they do risky things. I'm pretty sure we haven't gotten sick yet. We all had a cold 3 weeks ago but tested negative on rapid tests so who knows. I'm just defeated. So this is my confession. I'm a bad parent and putting my son at risk. I don't have what it takes to entertain him at home. He loves saying hi to people he walks by. He smiles the entire time. He loves joining groups of kids and starts interacting with out missing a beat. I want to know what it's like being a parent with out being on the verge of a panic attack all the time or the massive guilt.

So, if you've read my previous posts, you'll know my situation of living with antivax parents and how that has affected me mentally speaking. Well, to cut a long story short, I did what you recommended me: I got my shot in secret. Yesterday I got my first dose of Sputnik, and in February I'll try to get the second one. No side effects, apart from pain in the place of the injection. It's been more than 24 hours, so I guess I'm good on that side. It honestly feels surreal. I didn't even plan for it to happen that way, it was a spur of the moment decision. But now something troubles me. I fear my family may get to know it, and I don't feel the same having to hide it from them. I fear I was being impulsive and the best choice was to wait. I try to tell myself I had little choice, with Delta increasing the cases in my town, but it doesn't feel that way. There's also the fears theorists have put on my head, like infertility or altered DNA. Did I do it right? Or I should've just wait? I know it sounds silly, but I'm really second guessing myself. I was actually going to poost here for advice before going to the hospital, but as I said, it was pretty much a spontaneus decision. Thank you for reading, and to anyone who comments.

There are so many questions I realized I couldn't answer with certainty when discussing Covid with them. I was hoping to get some help for answers here. 1. If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? For example, if I am vaccinated and my cousin is not, we both meet my uncle who has Covid and are exposed. Since I am vaccinated, is there a higher chance that my body rejects the virus and so I don't become a carrier and spread it to others? If so, how much higher are the odds (if all other things are equal)? 2. If you had Covid previously, do you have a lesser chance of spreading it? Do Covid survivors have some immunity, so when they are exposed to someone with Covid, they have a much lesser chance to becoming a carrier. Since I had Covid AND I am vaccinated, am I much less likely to be a carrier now? Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but these questions are about the general odds. It seems like the narrative is constantly changing so it gets confusing. For example, now the news seems to be saying that even if your vaccinated you're going to get Covid, but you'll have milder symptoms. Or that you can spread it almost as easily as someone who is not vaccinated, etc. It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this. All news that I've been hearing are very vague with this type of stuff and I don't know why.",

It started out, in the early days of the sub, as a place to post good news stories as a counter to all the media dooming. In retrospect, that may not have been the best idea as it took the good news stories out of being peppered through the sub, where they may have been more uplifting overall. So I don't want to go back to that. Then it sort of morphed into 'why this week's Mink mutation/variant isn't going to evade all vaccines/have a 20x higher fatality rate' whenever a(n inevitably overblown) news story threatened to take over the sub. Which is still going to be needed occasionally but not every week.

Yesterday afternoon and into today I started experiencing mild cold symptoms (tickle in throat, very slight cough and very slight stuffy nose). Naturally, I'm panicking because, while it is cold season, I'm fearing that I have COVID, and the timing could not be worse. Not only am I supposed to see my family during the holiday, I also went to a couple holiday parties over the weekend. &amp;#x200B; I had COVID in January and I am fully vaccinated, but have not yet received my booster. I am 28 years old. I am planning on getting tested today. While worrying that I will miss the opportunity to see my family over Christmas is hard enough, if I test positive I would need to tell everyone I saw at work yesterday and over the weekend that I tested positive, and they would then need to get tested and potentially ruin their holidays. I would feel like such an awful person and that all of my friends and colleagues would see me as the one who ruined their Christmas. I really hope it's just a cold, but last time I thought I had a cold I got tested and wound up with COVID. I know this might sound selfish but I almost considered not getting tested just so I wouldn't know if I had it or not, but I know the moral thing to do is find out. Everyone I was at the parties with is vaccinated so hopefully they are okay if I test positive. &amp;#x200B; Am I doing the right thing? What if I had it a month ago and didn't notice, and I test positive because of the antibody and it's just a cold masquerading as COVID symptoms? How do I deal with the burden of potentially ruining the holidays of all my friends, putting others at risk? This is really weighing me down mentally and I could use support.

After speaking with my manager I was put on Medical Leave of Absence which allowed me to keep and self pay for my healthcare. My wife and I went into hard lockdown. Mostly deliveries of food, although I did do a little shopping at TJ's when they used to have senior hours. Fast forward to June of 2021. The grocery store called and said I either had to return to work or resign. This was a corporate wide policy. I resigned. The COBRA premiums were $790 per month. While I still had some savings, this was really beyond my budget. In September I got a job with a very small company. I work as an electromechanical tech fixing receipt printers. I have never removed my mask while in the building. Lunch? In my car. Sip of tea? Step outside. Snack or fruit? Step outside. On the 7th of this month one of my colleagues was in the same room as I and started to have a coughing fit. He ripped his mask OFF and coughed for 10 or 15 seconds. It must have been in that brief moment that he infected me. When I showed to work the next he was not in. I scheduled a PCR test and thankfully was able to schedule one for that Friday. When I woke that morning I had some unexplainable aches and pains. I was at work, but following my test appointment I went home. That night I had coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and a slight fever. It was either Thursday or Friday that I infected my wife. She has similar symptoms, but she has also lost senses of taste and smell. I cannot say just how angry I am at me colleague. Maybe it was the way I was brought up, but if I have a coughing fit I cover my mouth, not rip a protective barrier off. Anyway, just wanted to rant a little bit, thanks for reading.",

I just find myself constantly reminiscing about good memories, which makes me feel a little bit better. This pandemic has ruined my mental state and led me to burnout.

What are the rules in your country and how are you trying to work with or around them? Do you feel more optimistic or not about the coming months ahead? I know some people feel that with being triple vaxxed they feel more laid back and confident to do things and live life despite the situation (following local rules of course) whereas some are much more worried and hesitant of the virus, or somewhere inbetween, all of which are very understandable but I can imagine affect one differently mentally and how they view the situation. Personally I'm living quite normally now, I wear a mask in shops if its required and I cant go out partying as much as I want as the bars are shut but otherwise for me covid is now pretty much a frustrating nuisance than a huge roadblock. I'm triple vaxxed as are most people I know and I'm not particularly fazed anymore about catching it, if it gets me it gets me and I accept that. Perhaps because of this, I do feel very optimstic looking ahead now, things do feel like they are slowly getting better. What about you though?",

I know that this is trivial compared to what some folks out there are dealing with. **But my example is more of a 'straw that broke the camel's back' thing than the appointment cancellation itself.** I'm...tired. *So* tired. Things were mildly better back in June - early July when my area was in the green and I could at least go to appointments without fear. Now we're back to very high risk. I wanted to get my hair done for my birthday, because it's been a stressful month and life kind of sucks. But then I spoke to the salon today and they're doing NOTHING to counteract the Delta variant. No air filters, no mask requirements...nothing. Not even an open door. The last time I went, no one wore a mask but me and I had to request my hair stylist wear one. The idea of doing that in the red is just too much right now with my other stressors. And can I just add that it's really, really starting to piss me off how a lot of people people justify not masking anymore because 'If you got <ORG> or <ORG>, getting COVID is basically a bad head cold?' From what I've seen from firsthand accounts, **a breakthrough case is usually NOT just a bad head cold.** This shit can still knock you off your feet, cause breathing issues, and even cognitive impairments. And not to mention, you can still infect other people around you... I don't know about all of you, but I'd rather not even risk a slight chance of lasting damage after the exhaustion of the last year and a half. All my hard work of self-isolation, etc. going to waste would be horrible. How can so many other people NOT get that? **I just knew we were f/cked when mask mandates for indoor spaces were lifted virtually everywhere. Nice to see NY is bringing it back. Just wish it were a national ordinance.**",

For context, I had my second dose of <ORG> mid-April. I stupidly visited my sick, unvaccinated family last weekend, and spent a decent amount of time with them. My father and sister have since both tested positive for COVID-19 (my sister with the PCR test, and I believe my father with the antigen test). I was first exposed to them on Wednesday, Sept 15, and my last exposure was Sunday, Sept 19. I exhibited symptoms on Monday, received a PCR test Tuesday morning (administered by a healthcare professional), and received a negative result today. The reasons I'm doubting it are (1) I spent 5 days with a bunch of unvaccinated, sick people, (2) I myself am now sick. My symptoms are those of a cold/sinusitis (e.g., sneezing, runny nose, headache, fatigue, pressure in ears, etc), but it seems those are also the symptoms of COVID in vaccinated individuals. My sense of taste is subdued (not gone), but I think that's possibly due to congestion rather than COVID. So I'm sort of torn as to whether I should trust my recent test result. Did I get tested too early? Do I get retested? Is it truly just more likely that I have a cold/sinusitis?",

My boyfriend has been against the pandemic from the very beginning. He was wearing masks up to a certain point but has even stopped doing that. He has been kicked out of a grocery store for not wearing a mask before in the past year and has state that he will not will a mask in order to get a job, he will not wear a mask in order to enter a building and he wont wear one in order to be there for the birth of my child. He feels like his rights are violated heavily and while I agree with him on how wrong things are, I dont think he should miss the birth of his child for it; its his first child and we are not having anymore kids. I already have a child with a previous partner and do not want to get pregnant a 3rd time. He does not want to get vaccinated which is his right but I believe the Hosptial we are giving birth at requires non vaccinated people to have a mask on at all times. (Vaccinated people do have to wear one as well but I do not have to wear one during childbirth if I come out negative for Covid + proof of vaccine) I told him that if he doesnt want to wear the mask to stay home and not cause anyone stress but he wants to be there. He just doesnt want to not be forced to wear a mask the entire time and will only leave if forced to leave. I dont know what to do because I believe in what hes saying but i dont understand why he cant be selfless about this if its for the birth of his child.

I had COVID back in November, and at 6 months after infection, I got my antibody levels tested and was surprised to see I still had antibodies. My numerical result (on a <ORG> Elecsys test testing for Spike Protein Antibodies) was 246. Two months later I tested again (I was curious about rate of decline) and was at 226. I'm feeling like it's probably time to get vaccinated despite my previous infection, but I'm really curious to see how much higher vaccine-level antibodies are than my current levels. I know individual levels can vary and that we still don't know what antibody levels = immunity, but it would still be interested to know the common ranges seen after vaccination. Has anyone else gotten a test for the spike protein antibodies post vaccination? Would love to hear your results if you feel comfortable sharing. P.S. I'm basing my vaccination decisions off expert recommendations and studies surrounding reinfection rates/previous immunity vs vaccination immunity, etc. not off this Reddit thread - don't worry. :) But as someone who has a little bit of nervousness around taking any medication and who loves data, this type of information gives me more confidence in my decision.",

But the government just announced they will delay the gap between the two <ORG> shots from 21 days to 12 weeks 12 weeks!! They already did it with <ORG>. Theres no enough scientific evidence to support this, theyre doing it because we dont have enough vaccines and Im not sure how this is going to affect the immunity response. It makes me so angry because the government negotiated the vaccines with several pharmaceuticals since last year but this companies are delaying the vaccines supplies and we have received a minimum of what we purchased. And I think this happens in other third world countries. Is so unfair to see how wealthy nations are already applying boosters meanwhile here we have nothing! At this rate were never going to achieve a good level of protection until who knows when :(",

I'm classed as at risk and spent much of my childhood in hospitals which is why I've been extra careful. Due to circumstances with my anxiety preventing me from working, I'm moving in with my elderly grandmother where I intend to remain cautious. My grandmother still goes out, eats at pubs, goes to church, does not wear a mask in a taxi, etc. But I still have added anxiety about infecting her if I were to catch the virus. Onto the main topic: My best friends are getting married in October (6 weeks from now) and I've known about this for some time. They just asked me to confirm if I will attend the wedding as a bridesmaid. I haven't see a friend in almost 2 years at this point and get anxiety answering the door for deliveries, going to the shop, etc. There will be up to 40 guests in a room with a maximum capacity of 40. I live in the UK, so cases are fairly high and nothing like mask wearing or social distancing are mandated now. Logically I know that this is a high risk scenario, emotionally I am super anxious that if I don't go, I will lose my friends. I'm so anxious that I haven't even been able to reply with a yes or no or to share my concerns. What would you do? TLDR: I have bad anxiety, haven't seen friends in 2 years, live with elderly grandmother, and have been invited to be a bridesmaid at my best friends wedding. I get anxious just answering the door for deliveries or when going shopping for food. I'm also anxious I'll lose my friend if I can't go. Help!",

After that the only long covid symptom that I noticed was lack of concentration. Then, I got covid again on June 21 and have since been experiencing severe anxiety. I had never struggled with anxiety before. I had only had my first attack in January of this year but I can trace the trigger to some relationship issues I was dealing with at the time. However, ever since I got covid this past June Ive been experiencing anxiety on a more constant level. I had a really bad attack at work to the point that a coworker of mine took me to the ER. It comes out of nowhere, I cant place any specific triggers. Im not anxious about getting covid again, so its not that. Yesterday I had a really bad day because for the first time I was anxious all day long. Ever since I ended up in the ER I take a clonazepam pill only when Im having an attack. I thankfully started therapy today because I know I need help. Has anyone experienced post covid/long covid anxiety like this? Meaning not necessarily because one is afraid of covid.

Last year we were waiting for vaccines so those who didn't want to take any chances with this virus could get vaccinated. However now so many people clearly don't want the vaccines and everybody who wanted one already got one. My understanding is that pretty much every expert agrees that this virus will become endemic. I expect that everyone will get this but the vaccines will protect us from getting severe symptoms. I feel like everyone is really scared of getting this virus even if vaccines protect us from getting severe symptoms. What are we waiting for now? Last year we distanced and wore masks waiting for this vaccine that is suddenly not enough anymore. Now there is nothing else coming. Are we waiting for a third booster? But by the time we get it we'll already need a fourth one. Do we need to do this \"just a bit more\" until we get the fourth one and then the fifth one and so on? Breakthrough cases are happening already. What can we do about that? Get a booster every month? Vaccines are giving us the best chances of only getting mild symptoms but that is still not enough because we might spread this disease and create variants. What is the end goal?

Restrictions are back and they're probably not going any where. Cases are up and they're probably going to stay up. My whole life before Covid revolved around live music, both playing it and setting up for live events to earn a living. I genuinely don't think it's ever coming back. During May and June I stupidly let myself feel optimism that this would be over soon. I won't make that mistake again. Wasn't it Nietzsche who said that there's no true despair without hope? Whatever. Who fucking cares who said it. I was 28 when this pandemic started and turn 30 in December. That's two years of my life, the last bit of the prime of my youth, stuck inside. I know it's only been a year and a half since it got really bad but let's be honest here, the rest of 2021 is a wash because of Delta, and U.K. scientists just said pretty much definitively that it's only a matter of time before a completely vaccine resistant strain pops up. Looks like it's 2020 forever and ever! Two years of my life, my professional career, my creative outlet, an unfathomable amount of income, my savings, my mental and physical health, are all gone. All I feel anymore is the most extreme degree of anger that a human being is capable of feeling. Every day I read the news and feel like I'm being gaslit. I've given up. I want to believe that it will end, but I just can't. Two months of near normalcy and then it's like it's March 10th, 2020 all over again.",

So, after I graduated high school, I started planning things to do before I inevitably have to go. Traveling different cities I've never been to, working out to finally gain some muscles, And visiting various countries... That was until the early 2020 hit me. Daegu and every other cities have turned into one of the most dangerous places to go, the gym i was about to go has closed, and international travels have stopped. I was shocked, but I eventually have gotten it over since I could just postpone the enlistment at that time, to make sure that I could do it in 2021. But as the recent worldwide delta variant caused all of the countries that were finally lifting the quarantine - even the ones that have pretty much achieved \"the herd immunity\" vaccination rates to bounce all the way back to mid 2020, I am slowly becoming doubtful if I could ever be able to do as what I planned a couple of years ago. If I delay my enlistment again, my college studying plan will be ruined and will have terrible disadvantages over my friends who already have gone to the Korean army and probably will return earlier than me. And even if I enlist myself and serve in 2022 as I am planning right now, I won't have much time to do all the things I wanted, as I am aiming to become a professor and probably will be busy for most of my life after I return.

The shame of it, the disappointment, letting myself down, all of my hard work keeping safe being in vain, etc etc. Im vaxxed and boosted but im getting a second one at a different pharmacy. I have to. I've been having a two hour long panic attack over this and I cant, cant get covid. If I do I have to die. I dont even know why im posting. Looking for reassurance probably. Dont tell me 'oh it'll be mild' because that doesn't matter. I either don't get it and live, or I do get it and I off myself",

It'll be two days, indoors and it'll be about ten coworkers flying from all over the country (we have office locations throughout the us). I will also be flying to get to the meeting. I felt fine about not wearing a mask for the meeting but now I feel a bit worried, but should I be? Everyone will be vaccinated which is what was giving me peace of mind before all this news about the delta variant came out, but now I feel unsure again. I know that delta is spreading and is more contagious but I'm more concerned about whether the vaccine will be less effective come September since I got mine around March. Just looking for a reality check to see if I'm overthinking or if I am right to feel a bit uneasy.",

For one, the majority of classes at my school are being held full remote in the fall, though this is something Ive known about for months. Today, however, I just found out that my local anime convention, AnimeNYC, will not only be requiring the vaccine for all attendees, but they will also be requiring all attendees to wear a mask. I was already frustrated at de Blasio for trying to segregate NYC with the vaccine, but Ive become even more frustrated now that AnimeNYC has chosen to give in. I myself am already fully-vaxxed, but I think it is insane that they are requiring masks on top of it. If vaccines werent mandatory, I could understand requiring masks, but they are now being required at a vax-only event. I absolutely hate not being able to see faces in public, and Id hate it even more at the event I look forward to the most. Not only that, but other cons are implementing mask policies that dont allow costumes to have masks that cover the acceptable face coverings, making it impossible to cosplay certain characters. I thought for sure that the end of the year would give us total normalcy, but based on my classes being remote for the third semester in a row, and conventions introducing restrictions that change cosplay for the worse, I fear that the Delta variant is going to make the rest of this year a total shit show.",

So I do an at-home test, on the 13th negative, I kept sneezing so I do the second at-home test Wednesday negative. Still sneezing, went to the clinic that same day and got tested, negative. Still sneezing but now with a sore throat, I wait a few days and get tested that Friday, negative. It went away for a few days and came back and I ended up having a sneezing fit with a slight cough at night. Last Thursday I got a drive-thru PCR test because I haven't stopped sneezing.
