After doing a lot of research to questions I had regarding the vaccines I felt more comfortable finally booking to get one. It seemed like they are/were working. Lockdowns were being lifted, I saw online people doing things social and doctors celebrating etc. I avoid the news about covid for my mental health. Pretty much what I find out about the pandemic pops up on my feed. Now Im seeing so much conflicting information at the same time and Im confused and defeated. UK says pfizer vaccine is 88% effective against delta variant but is that only against hospitalizations? What about actually getting it and suffering? Israel says pfizer went from 64% to 39% . This may not be helpful but Ive recently read about a lot of people on reddit who are fully vaccinated getting covid - and what concerns me more is a lot of them are saying its kicking their ass. Why are they making it seem like on the news and in research that getting covid after vaccinated IF YOU DO is mild like sniffles? This is extremely concerning and Im feeling very discouraged and hopeless about this situation. I miss my family. So much has changed in my life since the pandemic started and I still dont see it going away any time soon. Even after Im vaccinated I still have to worry !? This truly fucking sucks.",

First two days: Cold Third day: Dry cough Fourth day: Mild dry cough Fifth day: Mild dry cough and mild cold In our country, there are only few people with the Delta variant - around 120. She hasn't experienced her loss of taste and smell, which brings me to wonder - is it possible she has the Delta variant, or is it also normal that she still has her taste and smell? I've googled online, but they're just saying that not losing your sense of taste and smell means your symptoms are more severe, which I fear, but highly doubt. Her symptoms so far are relatively mild so far, but of course, only time will tell. Apologies if I seem like I'm rambling. I'm only 16 and extremely worried. I know she's already vaccinated, but it would still be great to hear everyone's much-needed advice.",

Havent been to a bar, restaurant, nothing. Very few social gatherings but theyve been outdoors. I returned to work first week of June 2021 upon my boss request since I was vaccinated. I was all for it as I needed a normal schedule back in my life quarantine schedule was literally killing me I think. Now while neither of my bosses have taken this super seriously, my one boss is at least vaccinated. My other boss isnt. He got Covid once before and now was apparently exposed to it at some point last week when he played golf with his uncle (who runs our corporate office one town over). His uncle has Covid-19 fully. Unaware of his vaxx status. Anyway, I found this out through back channels and context clues. My actual two bosses did not disclose this to me. The one that was exposed (likely this past Thursday) I have not seen in person since Wednesday. However, he was in the office Friday while I was not. The one that was exposed is working from home today and the next several. Has anyone else encountered this type of situation and if so what did you do? My sanity doesnt want me to work from home again but my fear and anxiety are slowly taking back over. Any suggestions on what to do? For reference, by the way, our branch is a very small group. Today for example there are only 3 people here including me and we all have our own closed door offices. I only share a bathroom with one other person who is fully vaxxed.",

I think people who are vaccinated are not, on a population level, major contributors to the transmission of the disease, Dr. David Dowdy, a Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist, told me What is clear is that people who are vaccinated and have symptomatic breakthrough infections can transmit it to other people, Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University said. What is not at all clear is whether vaccinated asymptomatic people can transmit it. And my best guess is no or not very often. He added: Im not worried about an asymptomatic vaccinated person spreading it to me. Its also important that the country not respond in ways that would do more harm than good say, by delaying the full reopening of schools, Dowdy added. For vaccinated people, Covid still represents a very small risk, and the cost of our response should not exceed the benefits. I hope this helps somebodyit surely helped me.",

There's no boardwalk and the beach isn't packed. It's a family atmosphere. It's just me and my wife and 2 kids. My wife and I are fully vaccinated. 1 kid just got the 2nd shot and the other is too young to get vaccinated. We aren't planning any activities beyond sitting on the beach and enjoying time away from home. We still aren't dining in at restaurants and we wear masks indoors. I'm not too concerned about the beach since it is outdoors and we can maintain more than 6' of distance from everyone. I can't shake a fear about the rental house. I don't know who was in it before us. In theory, they are leaving at 11am, a cleaning crew will come in, then we can arrive at 4. That's a lot of presumably unmasked people in a space that I'm about to inhabit. It's probably irrational, but I don't want to sit on the couch, or use dishes, etc... I'm scared of the air conditioning. I know that sounds silly. We are planning to wash the sheets and towels when we get there since 1 kid is allergic to a few detergents. I see the numbers, usually a percentage, and I don't understand them. It's hard for me to interpret. I never see it as odds like 1 out of every so many people will get delta. I know a few people that are vaccinated that still got Delta, I read about it every day. I don't really understand what the chances are that we catch it. I really want to relax in the house, but I am freaked out. I've spent 18 months in a bubble in my house and I don't know how to get out of it. I know this seems silly. I'm embarrassed to feel this way. I want to get away and create fun memories with my wife and kids. What are the real risks of the rental house and what can I do to mitigate them?",

There's a few more articles on this, which I'll link below, but seeing this really helped me feel better today. In recent days I've been getting really worried that Delta would lead to my school once again cancelling in-person classes/activities for the fall, given how restrictive they've been throughout the pandemic. However, if this were true, it would mean that this current surge in the US peaks around mid-August, significantly sooner than the September/October peak I've heard previously, and would mean that the worst will be behind us by the time the fall semester starts. I think this is definitely a good sign for the US. Here's some other articles on this: [[url] [[url]",

We sent our toddler to part time daycare in early June and he almost immediately got an upper respiratory infection. After he recovered, we sent him back and he got hand foot and mouth disease. After he recovered from that, he got RSV, which my whole family, including my infant, now has. We were on the verge of taking my infant to the hospital yesterday because he keeps throwing up, but are monitoring him at home per doctors advice. They said because of everyone being masked up for so long its just hitting everyone hard right now.

It'll be two days, indoors and it'll be about ten coworkers flying from all over the country (we have office locations throughout the us). I will also be flying to get to the meeting. I felt fine about not wearing a mask for the meeting but now I feel a bit worried, but should I be? Everyone will be vaccinated which is what was giving me peace of mind before all this news about the delta variant came out, but now I feel unsure again. I know that delta is spreading and is more contagious but I'm more concerned about whether the vaccine will be less effective come September since I got mine around March. Just looking for a reality check to see if I'm overthinking or if I am right to feel a bit uneasy.",

Last year we were waiting for vaccines so those who didn't want to take any chances with this virus could get vaccinated. However now so many people clearly don't want the vaccines and everybody who wanted one already got one. My understanding is that pretty much every expert agrees that this virus will become endemic. I expect that everyone will get this but the vaccines will protect us from getting severe symptoms. I feel like everyone is really scared of getting this virus even if vaccines protect us from getting severe symptoms. What are we waiting for now? Last year we distanced and wore masks waiting for this vaccine that is suddenly not enough anymore. Now there is nothing else coming. Are we waiting for a third booster? But by the time we get it we'll already need a fourth one. Do we need to do this \"just a bit more\" until we get the fourth one and then the fifth one and so on? Breakthrough cases are happening already. What can we do about that? Get a booster every month? Vaccines are giving us the best chances of only getting mild symptoms but that is still not enough because we might spread this disease and create variants. What is the end goal? I can't see how this will ever end. I feel like everyone forgot how in January we were sure by spring everything will be back to normal. Now we say early 2022. What about early 2022? What will we say then? I think there is no end to this because there will never be a time where covid will go away. This thing infects animals too. How can we ever get rid of it?

I do have very bad anxiety, especially around health, so it's possible it's that, but I normally only have palpitations once or twice a year despite my anxiety and despite drinking caffeine every day (I haven't had any caffeine since getting the shot). I haven't had any palpitations for a few days now and noticed that when I wasn't focusing on my heart or reading about the vaccine, I didn't have anything wrong, which makes me think maybe it's my health anxiety. But when I look at the covidvaccinated reddit and read about people having long-term horrible effects from the vaccine, or people suddenly dying, it scares me again. I messaged my doctor and she still recommended getting the second shot. I'm just scared because I know the second shot is supposed to be worse. I'm supposed to get it on the 8th and got a text today about scheduling it, and I'm just paranoid and don't know what to do. I feel like I can't really talk to my family about it because they were wildly against me getting it in the first place and keep trying to talk me out of the second one, but I can't afford a bunch of doctor's visits on my own. It took a lot of hyping myself up to get the first one because I was scared, but I feel even more scared now. I'm not trying to get health advice, I'm just looking for info and reassurance because I feel kind of alone right now.",

No one sitting for 3-4 hours indoors, maskless with him, eating maskless with him, talking next to him, no one in the building got it. 20 people from us were unvaxxed/vaxxed with 1 dose, one was fully vaxxed and two had it. I worked on the movie Festival right after that in the same building and no one anywhere got it. We all got two mandatory tests, both negative for everyone except him. Even the two guys that shared a hotel room with him were negative. And no one even got sick, no one had as little as a headache. I don't understand. I still disinfect groceries. I still wear a mask even outdoors. I lost a dear person to this evil virus. I read people being careful and getting it. And yet 20 people in a room with a symptomatic person resulted in 0 infections.

I lost pretty much my entire mid 20s to this pandemic, and just when things were starting to get better, a new variant had to show up and it got to the point that even us vaccinated people are not 100% safe. During the time that it seemed safe, I planned a surprise dinner for my sisters 23rd birthday, but now Im wondering if I should cancel (cuz the reservations are for indoors, and at this point itll be hard to find anything else). SoI wonder it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are popping) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated? Im young as well (in my mid 20s) and everyone is also around the 23-26 range. All the people I live with are also vaccinated, and same with anyone who would be in our party (tho some of us are still with parents). I do live in an area with high transmission, so l guess Im worried about some random unvaccinated person a couple of tables over coughing and somehow having those droplets reach us.",

I'm so tired, I'm tired of the news, I'm tired of hearing about COVID, I'm tired of being told to worry, I'm tired being told I am a bad/selfish person because I simply just do not care about the case numbers and the deaths. We were told 2 weeks, and it turned into months. We were told vaccines would mark the beginning of the end, yet it just seems that the past is repeating itself. I hate it all. This coming fall semester I am taking a full set of classes. I am meant to go on site but looking at how we are reacting to these variants I doubt it will be anywhere close to a normal semester. If we go hybrid or remote, I will not succeed, I have ASD and I suffered and stressed through my classes in the spring semester to get decent grades, and I only had 3 courses. Not to mention the loss of social gatherings would just make me feel isolated and alone once again. As a psych major, I know that these strong reactions come from the trauma experienced going through lockdown the first time. But it feels like a cycle, it feels like nothing is enough. The vaccine wasn't enough, they said it was, but clearly now it isn't. So when and how does this end? I'm losing hope, and like others on this sub I feel that my youth is being taken from me. I feel cheated, and lied to, by my government, and by society as a whole.",

My siblings are also around as well as my nephews and nieces. However as I am on the train home I'm starting to deeply regret my decision. Yesterday we had a big argument because I suggested that we should do those quick self tests just to feel a little bit more safe. They are all vaccinated, but me being only 24 did not have the chance to get it yet (this is Portugal by the way, I know in the US for instance I could already get my vaccine). Anyway, they basically disagree said that they are safe now so they would not have any care, and go out and won't get tested. I've tried to reason explaining that I am still unvaccinated amd therefore at higher risk than them, and would be more comfortable of we still were a bit careful. I am not asking them to get tested every day, I plan to test myself very 4 days or so but would be fine if they did it once a week or so (doing what 2 tests in total while I am there). I'm feeling terrified, they say that I am being selfish for trying to impose some rules, but I am just trying to protect myself, I am absolutely terrified of getting Covid, and have been able to resist all this time and want to continue to do so. What do you advise me to do? What can I do to protect myself from my family? I plan to wear my mask in common spaces even though I know it annoys them, and maybe trying to prepare my food separately when they are not around. Being careful to wash my hands a lot and avoiding close contact with them as often as I can. Is there any crucial thing I should do too or am I forgetting something?

Looking for support or advice So over the past year/2years I've had gnarly allergies and developed chronic nasal congestion, reguring sore/swollen throat, and occasional shortness of breath. Ontop of that I have chronic faituge and since I was a kid Ive had IBS symptoms so occasionally have diarrhea. I feel like every single month I have *some* combination of these symptoms, usually lasting 1-2 weeks per cycle. And am exhausted from all the paranoia around, is it covid?? Do I need to get tested and isolate?? Am I infecting people arlund me?? Do i need to disclose *all* of my symptoms to everyone I meet?? It feels like my body is just falling apart constantly, qnd every time I get tested for covid it comes out negative. (Got tested maybe 7/8 times over the past year. Feels like my body is becoming the Boy Who CrIed Wolf, and then one day if it actuslly is covid, I'm scared Im writing it off as part of the chronic/reccuring ailment.

The short version is that my partner and I are both fully vaxxed but also both \"high risk\". Before Delta showed up in the US we booked a trip to a Florida beach with our also vaxxed but not high risk friends. At the time I had no concerns about the trip at all. But now I'm looking at the news in Florida and am starting to have concerns about the trip. We'd be going a few weeks after schools opened and it looks like hospitals are already filling. My partner works (fully masked) with the public, so I know we could already catch Delta at any time, but I am worried about catching it a 14 hour drive from home and in a place with very limited medical support. We also have very limited funds and really couldn't afford to extend our stay in the case that we got too sick to make the drive back up. We also really can't afford to have my partner take a week off from work and then take off another 10 days if we ended up exposed. I don't want to disappoint my friends though who already asked weeks ago to promise that we would go on the trip no matter what happened with Delta. I know that isn't a good reason to do something, but I am wondering if I'm being overly cautious and ruining a trip for three people unnecessarily. I know breakthroughs are relatively rare, but I already know half a dozen people at work who had them and their symptoms were way more in line with \"flu\" than \"sniffles\". Again, I know that we still need to live our lives and the vaccines are extremely protective, but since we are high risk, low funds, and would be so far from home, I'm worried about what would happen if we were to get sick down there. Does anyone have any input on if this is relatively safe or a bad idea? The beach itself is more residential and fairly remote from what I can tell. Thank you!",

But ever since then, chatter has gradually increased about this, and Jack has doubled down on his claims: [url] <PERSON>' latest show has now put a date on it: August 11.

Fast forward now and i am completely different thankfully. Although I gotta say there are still quite some things that I wish I could let go. One of those is showering. I take a whole hr washing every body part for like 20 seconds multiple times. On top of that I constantly wash my hands repeatedly after touching a dirty part of my body that hasnt been cleaned yet. This also because I go to the gym so I psych myself out. I always end my showers with cleaning the inside of the shower including the handles as a just in case as well. Even when I come home I take my clothes off then proceed to spray alcohol where I took them off. I really wanna stop. I know transmission through touch is very rare but my OCD is getting to me still.

Everyone has since been vaccinated and now seems to not care as much. Theyre comfortable dining outdoors, seeing friends, and forget to wash their hands for the full 20 seconds after coming home sometimes. Meanwhile, Im not comfortable with any of that, and I still wash my hands religiously, wipe down high touch surfaces, etc. Ive moved out during the pandemic, which has helped me since I honestly do not feel safe at home (COVID-wise). My family sometimes makes me feel bad because if we ever do get together for dinner, we cant eat outdoors because of me. Or Ill ask that they limit seeing others in the week prior to us getting together. Im supposed to be seeing my family for the first time in a few months tomorrow. I again asked them to not see people, which they agreed to. My mom saw a few friends, and my sister attended a wedding. I told my family I will no longer be going to dinner tomorrow. Part of it is COVID - yes, I dont want to go home especially after my sister went to a wedding. But a big part of it is the constant making me feel bad about my boundaries (which Ive clearly communicated) this entire time. Its the constant not respecting my boundaries, and its really frustrating.

So, after I graduated high school, I started planning things to do before I inevitably have to go. Traveling different cities I've never been to, working out to finally gain some muscles, And visiting various countries... That was until the early 2020 hit me. Daegu and every other cities have turned into one of the most dangerous places to go, the gym i was about to go has closed, and international travels have stopped. I was shocked, but I eventually have gotten it over since I could just postpone the enlistment at that time, to make sure that I could do it in 2021. But as the recent worldwide delta variant caused all of the countries that were finally lifting the quarantine - even the ones that have pretty much achieved \"the herd immunity\" vaccination rates to bounce all the way back to mid 2020, I am slowly becoming doubtful if I could ever be able to do as what I planned a couple of years ago. If I delay my enlistment again, my college studying plan will be ruined and will have terrible disadvantages over my friends who already have gone to the Korean army and probably will return earlier than me. And even if I enlist myself and serve in 2022 as I am planning right now, I won't have much time to do all the things I wanted, as I am aiming to become a professor and probably will be busy for most of my life after I return.

I am now fully vaccinated with Biontech (I got my second shot on 24.07) and I want to hang out with friends again. My BF's cousin invited me to drink at his house. In total there would be four people (me, my bf, his cousin and his girlfriend). Everyone is fully vaccinated. Up until now, I have only stood in front of people with my FFP2 mask. I try to be less worried but I don't really have the guts to take it off unless I'm outside and no one's in sight.. I've met my BF a couple of times outside after I got my second shot but we both kept our masks on at all times. So, I really want to ask if it is safe to see people without masks when everyone is fully vaccinated. I am 23F and I have asthma and rheumatoid Arthritis. The one person who worries me in my family is my mom. She has diabetes, hypertension, hashimoto's, liver disease etc. She is in her early 50s. She is fully vaccinated with <ORG>. (Everyone else is my family is vaccinated too btw) I live with her, so if I do catch COVID despite being vaccinated, I am afraid I would pass it onto her. Alternatively, I also thought about isolating myself for some time after my hangout. I would be fine wearing a mask around my family for 1-2 weeks. I get tested regularly anyways (once a week) so there's that, too. Sorry if this seems paranoid, I just wanna be on the safe side. But I also get so depressed not having seen anyone for so long.",

Im in a very blue area and masks have come back in a nearby town and the university I attend is requiring both masks and vaccines this fall, due to Delta. I feel like its only a matter of time until mask mandates are in my town again for everything and its really making me spiral. I got the vaccine and had no problem with it, but it feels like it doesnt even matter at this point. If an entire campus that is vaccinated, surrounded by a community with high vaccinations, isnt safe then what would ever be safe?! Im deeply worried that masks are just a permanent part of life now in public, at least in my area. Ive voiced my concerns with some people and I just get shot down with its just a piece of cloth, its no big deal, itll just be temporary, etc. Maybe Im crazy but masks are worst part of the pandemic for me. I wore them where required this whole time, but wearing them and even seeing them really negatively effects my mental health. I feel like Im trapped in a dystopian movie and cant escape. A constant reminder to be afraid, that this isnt safe. I just hate how these concerns are always just swept aside as being whining or whatever. I just dont see how masks wont become permanent given the current logic of the mandates (vaccinated people can still spread). Can someone just give me some copium that these mandates will be over quickly? Like if the Delta wave ends, can I take the mask off? As crazy as it sounds, the new mask mandates are scarier to me than the Delta wave itself, but I feel like Im the only one who is upset about it.",

Im not a conspiracy nut, Im a left wing socialist student who is usually on the \"left\" for many many issues. The two things about this vaccine that gets me is that there have been no long term trials and the censorship coming from the pharmaceuticals . Firstly, my anxiety about the long term trials comes from all the previous drugs that failed on mass as a result of improper testing (thalidomide for example). Secondly, I *really* dont like that the pharmaceutical companies that made the vaccines included no liability clauses in their contracts w/ the gov, and they have made BILLIONS- why would they want to admit the vaccine didnt work even if we saw hundreds of adverse reactions? I feel like there is no transparency and I just dont trust them to let us know if it does go wrong. Ive always been wary of big business and this is the first thing I thought when the vaccine was created last year and I just havent been able to think differently on this issue Thats literally all I think.

I'd worked from home since long before the world went remote and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 year old since her birth. We're very much homebodies, so the lockdowns and such weren't a huge departure from the life we'd been leading prior. That's all changed with the school year quickly approaching. We'd initially planned on sending our daughter to Pre-K last year but opted not to because of our concerns about the virus. With an October birthday she's going to be one of the older kids in class this year and she is severely overdue for the type of social interaction that school provides. Anyway, sending unvaccinated kids back to school with the more transmissible Delta Variant being prevalent seems like a recipe for disaster to me. However, I don't think my kid can afford to be isolated another year. We're in a city where Pre-K is provided through the public school system on a first come first serve basis, so, pulling her and reenrolling her later in the semester once vaccinations are available for children under 12 isn't an option. On the plus side, masks are required but its a full-day class, so the kids have to remove those for breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm just at a loss for what to do and it disgusts me that we're still in this situation. At this point, my daughter would be absolutely heartbroken if we pulled her out of school but I'd much rather her heartbroken than suffer any longterm effects (or severe effects) of COVID.

A recent study out of the University of Maryland presents the first evidence that full vaccination against COVID-19 actually SUPPRESSES emergent mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants therefore successfully debunking the myth that vaccines promote mutations. &gt; &gt;COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2 and full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant mutation frequency. Researchers here showed that countries with higher vaccination rates generated FEWER mutations, suggesting less of a chance for the virus to gain virulent mutations in high vaccinated countries. Researchers found vaccination coverage rate was inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 16 countries of 20 countries studied and discovered Delta variants evolved differently under the positive selection pressure in the United Kingdom and India. Conclusion? Vaccines SUPPRESS emergent mutations. They DONT promote them. &gt; &gt;You can find the study here: [[url]",

Something feels off, as my state should be in a good situation, but we're still seeing rising case numbers. I simply don't understand it, and as someone who suffers from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Depression, and ADHD, I am so shocked that progress is reversed in this state. I've been having panic attacks, tremors, and headaches, because I'm worried that all my plans for the remainder of the year (movies, my first rave in Berkeley on 9/18, etc.) could be shot down. I feel like it will be fine with high vaccination rates, but look at Hawaii. They're having more restrictions and they have vaccinated 85% of their adult population It can be easy to blame the unvaccinated, but unless they're immunocompromised or under 12, I'm sorry, I don't care about them. Fuck em. \"Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\". Just require vaccines for non essential places (bars, movies, clubs, restaurants, gyms). I hate masks, but it's not the end of the world (I live in LA, so they're required). Are my fears/stresses justified? Or Do you think It'll be fine, and I should just try to think about the present? Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry if I sound so paranoid. Uncertainty is my biggest fear, and it's been eating my alive for about a month now.",

You can imagine how much I miss them I started hearing news of some cons reopening with varying restrictions, (though I wish those restrictions were tighter) and had hope of a 2022 con season. In fact, my favorite con announced they're returning in January and I'm hoping to go. However, a con called megaplex just took place, and immediately after accounts of catching covid started pouring in, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated (because of delta). Conventions are infamous for spreading illness even before covid, so there's a real scare here. Now I'm seeing takes that absolutely zero conventions should take place in any capacity, and more specifically that it's better for them to go under than to think about reopening. As if it's easy for an organization low on money to just run a convention again. And it depresses the hell out of me. having a mask rule + proof of vaccination + limited capacity really shouldn't be hard...but the worst part is I know that at this point that might not even be enough. If with those two things, we STILL can't hold them at all, when the hell are we ever getting out of this?

I am not in the US, I am in Southeast Asia where things are really bad here, vaccination rates are low, and most restrictions have not been lifted. I know people are just trying to be helpful, but COVID is a completely different situation in other parts of the world, and it sucks even more to hear that other countries are getting back to normal when your own is still stuck in a mess with no end in sight. I just hope that people can be more conscious of the fact that there exists a whole world outside of America, and everyone's experiences with COVID is different. Maybe don't jump to conclusions that everyone on reddit is from a developed, Western nation with sufficient resources to deal with this virus? Remember that the WHO said this pandemic will not be over until it's over for the whole world.

Last weekend I hung out with a group of friends at a bar (this bar required proof of vaccine for entry) and my group of 6 were all in close proximity, indoors and sharing food. My friend (fully vaxxed) tested positive for covid a few days later after experiencing very mild symptoms so the rest of us went to get tested as well. We all tested negative with no symptoms! I honestly felt such a relief after this. Not just because I tested negative, but it just truly affirmed for me how well they work. Delta is scary, but had we all not been vaccinated this would have likely been so much worse. We live in a state where Covid hasnt been too bad, and honestly we had relaxed quite a bit, but this definitely was a bit of a reality check but also a major sense of relief at the same time.

I don't know what difference it makes which one I'll be taking. I have distanced myself from all the news and am not well informed at all about all the different types of vaccines. It's not a smart thing to do on my part but I've had a tough year and it was the last thing on my mind. I've heard some people say that at my age it's not worth it to take the vaccine because the benefits of not catching a virus that would likely not do much harm to me to begin with is overshadowed by any potential side effects that the vaccine could cause. Is this true? Am I just overthinking this? Could there be any long term side effects from any of these vaccines, or will it really most likely not impact my life in any way other than just maybe getting sick for a couple of days after taking the vaccine (which has happened to some people I know)?

I feel like Im on crazy pills and dont know how to explain it to them in a way that doesnt make me want to pull my hair out. Theyre looking at the rates of hospitalization and deaths in each state, per 100,000, for fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. Theyre looking at data reported by the NYTimes which was updated 3 days ago. So for example, California, where we live, has reported 647 hospitalizations and 58 deaths for unvaccinated people, and 9 hospitalizations and 1 death for vaccinated people. Now, theyre calculating that 58/647= .089, and 1/9= .11, so you have a higher chance of dying in the hospital from Covid if youre vaccinated (instead of realizing that this data really means you are 58X more likely to die of Covid if youre unvaccinated in CA). Basically theyre saying the vaccine doesnt work to help people who are already hospitalized because you have a higher rate of dying in the hospital if youre vaccinated. This data may be *technically* correct, but its missing the context of the fact that the vaccine keeps people out of the hospital in the first place so one person out of nine dying skews the number outrageously. So what do you guys think, how do I explain to them that this interpretation of data is erroneous??",

And I blame the news for that. News always fear monger and that makes people go crazy, sad, scared, and confused. Why, when I was working as a courtesy clerk at Vons, people argue for masks. There was theses two men arguing each other. One is wearing a mask and the other guy is not wearing a mask. The guy not wearing a mask says he believe in science and the other guy wearing mask tells him that he is a selfish a-hole. And the news always makes false information about the vaccines and it's no wonder nobody wants to or too scared to get vaccinated. I was nervous to get vaccinated, but I got vaccinated and it wasn't so bad. Why can't the news be hopeful, for once. Something must be done with the news to end this fear monger if we want to end this pandemic. Sure, the virus will sadly last forever, but they can't let this pandemic last forever. Stupid news!",

Countrywise, 75% of all adults have received at least one dose and this number is still growing, as the rollout is now focused on young adults (18-25) who werent eligible to get their jab before. While this might seem a vaccine success story, it did not come without its hurdles. Vaccine rollout has been dramatic, to say the least. Bolsonaro is an anti-vaccine apologist and has sabotaged vaccine purchases since they first came. Being the 2nd worst affected country in the world, with over 500k dead, didnt change his heart. In stark contrast to other national leaders on the world, he did not get his jab and does not plan to do so. Skepticism and politicization of vaccines soon struck. We are screwed, I thought. Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US. Young people werent likely to get their jab this year. But somehow, it happened. Despite being disdained by the federal government, vaccines were soon became a representation of hope, soon became something the people needed to fight for if we were to have any chance against this disease. Little by little, Brazilian social media feeds were flooded with pics and videos of people being vaccinated. They put on their best clothes, posting their photos with inspiring takes on the importance of vaccines on Instagram. There is even a joke running here this vaccine only works if you post about it on social media This kind of good and organic peer pressure paid off - upon seeing their friends and relatives getting their jab, most Bolsonaro supporters reluctantly jumped in line to get their jab, even those people would avoid being excluded by their families. Against all odds, we are making it. We dont have many fully vaccinated people yet (just 30% of adult population). Peer pressure and social media work wonders. Close people getting their shot and sharing their experiences work better than some celebrity endorsements and free ice cream.",

My boss, the only doctor in the private healthcare office I work for (all vaccinated, as far as I am aware), tested positive yesterday after feeling ill on Thursday. I was in the office around him often for 8 hours on Wednesday and for two hours on Thursday before he went home, wearing masks the whole time. In addition, the other person working in the office on Wednesday is now feeling ill and is getting tested as well. I am having no symptoms and tested negative using a rapid result test on Sunday, but I know those can throw false negatives, so I got a PCR test today along with my roommates who I could've potentially exposed and am now waiting on the results from that. My boss says if I test negative I should be able to go in from Thursday on (even though the practice will be mostly non-functioning given he's obviously not going in for at least a week), but I don't trust his advice given he's been attending weddings and conferences this summer. Even if I do test negative, because I work in a healthcare setting (non-emergency, I don't want to give the exact profession but in a similar vein to a physical therapist's office) I feel I should quarantine for the full ten asymptomatic days to be certain I'm not going to experience delayed infection, and because I live with immunocompromised and at-risk individuals. Is this an unreasonable ask? He's making me feel unreasonable for being wary at the thought of going in before I've quarantined the full amount; we only have a handful of front desk staff and if even one of us gets sick the others have to pick up the slack. On a more personal note, is there any way y'all have found to deal with the intense guilt of potentially exposing people to Covid? I've been doing everything I can since March 2020 to avoid this exact scenario and it feels so endlessly frustrating that simply working to try to survive has landed me in this mess.",

These are only my feelings at the moment, but I feel like getting them out and having feedback from others would help my COVID recovery, at least mentally. Here it goes. I tested positive for COVID after pretty much my whole family got it. While I only tested positive in the last 16 hours, I have felt off since 8/12. Here is where I'll let you in on my dilemma, and I do not expect pretty much any of you to agree with me. There is a girl that I work with that I think is insanely pretty and cool. I have been gradually getting closer to her over the last few months and I feel like we're really starting to become friends. The problem is, her last day of work is on 8/20 before she goes back to school, and I would really like to stay in contact with her while she is at school. I was planning on asking for her snapchat on 8/20 which is the next and last time I will see her for some time. My COVID diagnosis threw me for a loop I did not expect and if I follow all guidelines I will not be able to see her by the time she leaves for school. This has led to me planning to hide my diagnosis in order to see her and talk to her before she goes away until December. Obviously this puts her and my other coworkers at risk of catching the virus, but I feel like I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't make an effort to talk to her. I know this is immature, and I know that this has an answer that is very obvious to most. I only ask for respectful feedback.

I honestly don't know what I was thinking-- about an hour and a half in, the space got even more crowded and I finally got uncomfortable enough that I decided to leave. I'm ashamed and embarrassed and at a loss with myself. I promise I'm not looking for reassurance here; I know that I made an awful decision, and I want to handle it now as responsibly as possible to avoid infecting anyone in my community. I'm fortunate to be a grad student at a university where we have access to incredibly accurate rapid testing (results in 6-24 hours, generally), and I've decided to self-isolate until I get a negative test result. I canceled several in-person meetings this week, the most important of which being with my thesis advisor who has a 10 year old son. I told him what happened and that I thought we should postpone, and he suggested we met Friday morning, of course pending a negative test result. The new CDC guidelines say that you should get tested 3-5 days after exposure, so my question is, if I test Thursday morning (roughly 4 and 1/2 days after potential exposure) is that long enough to really trust a negative result, or should I wait, push back with my professor, and self-isolate for longer? Could I trust a Friday morning test? Saturday morning? Any advice would be deeply appreciated-- I really appreciate this community and this space.",

During this period, a close family member in my other country of citizenship became very ill, and I needed to get there immediately. Additionally, in order to be able to see her, because of strict rules, I needed to be fully vaccinated. And so, I took my second vaccine there, and the physician accepted the proof of my first vaccine from my residence country. It was the best decision, because I was able to spend an entire month with my family member, and left feeling at least somewhat less heavy-hearted. The problems is that my residence country will *not* accept my vaccination record from the other country, and so I am officially \"not fully vaccinated.\" What this means is that I cannot be granted the current \"Vaccination Passport\" available to all residents, which allows those fully vaccinated to travel to all other EU countries without quarantine, testing, or other problems. Without this, traveling - which I need to do for my work - will become extremely difficult, often impossible. So I'm thinking of just going to get my \"second\" vaccine here in my country of residence, which is now available, and then the authorities will issue the passport so that I can get on with my life as much as possible. I have read quite a few things from what appear to be reasonable sources online, and it seems that getting a third vaccine within a period of three months wouldn't be harmful - but I obviously want to be very, very careful. Anyone have any solid information/advice one way or the other? Thanks in advance.",

He knew he had covid and wouldn't admit it, putting not only himself but my 84 year old grandma and my two uncles in danger. One of them (the one who ended up dragging him to the ER) has fybromialgia, so his health is also incredibly compromised because of that. Yet he risked his life for my dad. Luckily, no one else ended up as bad as he is right now because they all got vaccinated back in the day, and only got infected but had very few symptoms. As far as the situation with my dad goes, doctors have been honest with us, and although it is not impossible for my dad to get out of this, he's in a very very critical state. Because of this, I've barely been able to eat or sleep, anxiety is eating me alive and I've started to notice how this is affecting my moods. I can barely get a hold of myself. I'm extremely angry and sad and resentful and tired. All at the same time. I've started to snap at people, and I have the constant need to scream until my throat breaks. I literally feel like I'm going insane. I've read about his complications and how fucked they are, and I realize that doctors can only do so much and chances of him making it out are very slim. Everyone around me is trying to be supportive, and say things like \"don't loose your faith\", \"as long as he's alive there's a chance\", and YES, there's obviously still hope but it's honestly maddening. Not even the doctors know what the hell is going to happen because that's what covid does. One day they're fine, and literally hours later they're dying. How am I not supposed to loose my shit? The waiting is killing me. Anyone going/has gone through a similar situation? Any advice? Please help.",

I'm classed as at risk and spent much of my childhood in hospitals which is why I've been extra careful. Due to circumstances with my anxiety preventing me from working, I'm moving in with my elderly grandmother where I intend to remain cautious. My grandmother still goes out, eats at pubs, goes to church, does not wear a mask in a taxi, etc. But I still have added anxiety about infecting her if I were to catch the virus. Onto the main topic: My best friends are getting married in October (6 weeks from now) and I've known about this for some time. They just asked me to confirm if I will attend the wedding as a bridesmaid. I haven't see a friend in almost 2 years at this point and get anxiety answering the door for deliveries, going to the shop, etc. There will be up to 40 guests in a room with a maximum capacity of 40. I live in the UK, so cases are fairly high and nothing like mask wearing or social distancing are mandated now. Logically I know that this is a high risk scenario, emotionally I am super anxious that if I don't go, I will lose my friends. I'm so anxious that I haven't even been able to reply with a yes or no or to share my concerns. What would you do? TLDR: I have bad anxiety, haven't seen friends in 2 years, live with elderly grandmother, and have been invited to be a bridesmaid at my best friends wedding. I get anxious just answering the door for deliveries or when going shopping for food. I'm also anxious I'll lose my friend if I can't go. Help!",

I live with my parents, one of whom has had historic lung issues, is 71, and also probably high risk. We're all fully vaccinated. My goal, really, throughout all this is to reduce my chance of *infection* to near zero. It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid. I know being vaccinated my chances of hospitalization and death are low, that's not really what I'm worried about. I'm a wind player, and theoretically have an orchestra concert coming up mid september. I'm in Oregon where cases are pretty out of control. From what research I've seen, playing a wind instrument is essentially identical to just talking in terms of risk factor. So that's fine. Assuming no precautions are taken, that'll be something like 20 people within 15 feet of me, possibly unvaccinated, unmasked, not particularly well ventilated space, for multiple hours. To me that is very clearly an untenable risk, even though I am vaccinated. I guess the first gut check - am I already being over-cautious in thinking that? If I'm right that that is way too risky. What precautions would be reasonable to ask for? If everyone is vaccinated, all non-wind players are masked, and I'm 6 feet away from everyone else, that's about as many mitigating factors as possible - and I honestly can't tell if that's enough to be safe or not. It's still being unmasked in a room full of people for hours, doing an activity that for me involves a lot of deep breaths.

We're both fully vaccinated and Paris (where we'd spend most of our time) seems to be doing well with vaccination rates and requiring vaccines to do most activities. However, we planned this trip in mid-June when things seemed like they were getting better-- now, with Delta, it's feeling a bit riskier to attempt international travel. My question is, which factors would you weigh the heaviest if you were thinking about traveling? Right now the thing I'm most worried about is getting a positive test before returning to the US and having to quarantine in Paris-- that would be a whole mess. But I don't know if that's reason enough to cancel the whole trip, and after a year and a half of being stuck at home, I desperately want to go.

If there's anything this pandemic has taught us, it is that people will lie and do whatever they want to. Of course the proof can be faked, but it's still better than nothing.

While I wanted to get it and was eligible months ago, I wasn't allowed. They seemed so very genuinely worried that it would hurt me, and it was emotionally taxing to keep arguing against them. They wouldn't listen. Since I don't leave the house much, I figured it would be okay to give up. I agreed to wait until FDA approval, then get it. In a case of the worst possible timing ever, though, just as a vaccine receives full approval, there's been an outbreak at my father's workplace. A big one. He tested negative four days ago, and hasn't been to work for unrelated reasons since then, but I'm still scared. I've asked him to mask, isolate, even open a window and he's said no. Every time he coughs within earshot, I want to claw my eyes out. So, while I've finally got a vaccine appointment for 2 days from now, I'm worried it's too late. I'm taking my temperature constantly, checking my breathing, washing my hands like crazy, wiping stuff down... I don't know what else to do.

Ive disinfected most of anything that would be touched, and Ive also turned on the ceiling fan, AC, and cracked the windows open (I said I would cover the electric bill).

Do I need to self isolate? We both go to the same university and he said student health would reach out to me with info but they have not sent me anything yet. I have no symptoms. 3. Does anyone have testimonies of similar situations where you had to live with someone who got COVID? Did you end up getting sick? What did you do? Let me know, and thanks for the help!",

One of my good buddies just informed the group chat last night that he tested positive for Covid four days ago (Thursday), and showed flu-like symptoms at the beginning of the week (Monday). He said that he is feeling better, and by the time we leave for the trip, which is this Thursday it will be 10 days he's been in isolation and according to the CDC, he should be cleared to resocialize and therefore not miss the trip. I know there are a lot of factors and it's hard to determine when it might be safe to be around others, but that time frame still seems very tight. For the record, everyone in our party is fully vaccinated, so there is some protection. But we will be in tight quarters for a few days, and I'll be in close contact with family for some time after this trip. We are all getting tested, and he said he will as well. There is a light understanding that if he tests positive that he won't go, but he has been kind of forward stating that there is a high probability he will even if he is \"Not Contagious\". Which makes me feel like he might try to attend regardless. The fact that it's a breakthrough infection is making me feel a little overly cautious about wanting to attend. Overall, is that timeline a little too tight or am I overthinking things? \\------------------------------------------- **TL;DR** \\- A friend had a breakthrough infection less than a week ago, showing flu-like symptoms. He's feeling better, but would like to still attend a trip we leave for this week, which would mark exactly 10 days he's been in isolation since showing symptoms but would be 7 days after he's tested positive. Is that timeframe too tight, and am I overthinking about not attending the trip?",

Apparently he got it at school after they started a week ago. He got tested today as the school had been getting reports on several other students testing positive. He had his confirmation yesterday and I as well as other family members were present. Which has me a bit worried (My family and importantly my grandparents who were there are fully vaccinated) yet I am still worried, especially for my brother. I am worried he will feel like this is his fault. The whole situation is just really stressful. I live in another city and traveled home last night (wearing a mask and keeping my distance to other people) but I am still worried about having spread the virus as I took a train home. I have scheduled a test for myself tomorrow and am really hoping I test negative. I live quite far away and they are swamped with informing the rest of the attendees about how to proceed. Luckily most of the guests (with the exception of three teenagers) were vaccinated. There weren't that many guests though just 13 - 15. However I just feel stressed and worried about this whole affair. Wondering if I should reach out to my brother to let him know that it is not his fault or if I should just let him be and keep communication restricted to my parents until he feels better (He has light symptoms for now).

As a side note, Im also terrified my dad caught it when dropping off medicine and food to her. He is fully vaccinated and he intended to drop stuff off on the porch but as he was walking up her driveway, she decided it would be a good idea to come outside. She stood at the door with it open, and my dad stopped and never came within 10 feet of her. Probably closer to 15 feet. He sat the bags down and quickly turned and walked back to the car. They were both wearing masks. He was probably within 15-20 feet for like 15 seconds. Im just mortified he mustve gotten it somehow. I wish she didnt walk outside and part of me is mad at her for it, but I know she just didnt think of that and I shouldnt be upset with her. Shes going through a lot right now and she has anxiety too. I cant imagine how scared she is. Just needed to vent a bit - thanks for reading, guys.

I didn't know the symptoms from the second vaccine would be this rough for me. I was out of the house from 9am-5pm (and didn't sleep well that night either). I couldn't sit still in classes and writing was so difficult because I had no strength in me. Wearing a mask made more heat build up around my face and head, causing more pressure. I took so much tylenol (2 tablets every four hours) because my fever kept coming back every hour and it was so bad that I felt like I was going to pass out but kept pushing through. My appetite decreased immensely because of the fevers (102F) so I ate less than 500 calories for the past two days. Driving back home was a hassle because I couldn't even completely push down on the gas and brakes, I was drained and aching. My entire body felt like there were sharp needles jabbing at my skin. Taking a mere step was just agonizing. Finally, I got to rest when I came home but still feel bleh today as well and am currently in bed. Probably slept 18 hours total. My symptoms were worse because my body got no rest and I also didn't sleep well the night I got my vaccine (which was monday evening). People were informing me it wasn't that bad for them and that I should just get the second shot, but I shouldn't have listened! Everyone's body reacts differently. Anyways, moral of this - please rest and take the second vaccine on your days off just in case if you haven't yet, don't suffer like me. Other than that, WOO-HOO I'M FULLY VACCINATED!",

After I got the second coronavirus vaccine(<ORG>) on the 19th of June I started to have strong heart palpitations and trouble breathing for a day and a half. That all subsided but later after 13-14 days I started to get the same symptoms that persisted for 5 days.

He made his last car payment on the same day that he tested positive. He always came across as so intelligent and confident. However, after getting sick and fearing that he was going to die, sounded so scared and defeated. Last weekend he crashed and was placed on a vent.

At that point I knew that if he survived that he would be in such horrible condition that he would have no quality of life. I am relieved, given the circumstances, that he died.

I hate wearing masks. I hate having to social distance. I hate not being able to do anything. Almost 2 years of reliving the same day over and over again....",

I'm not sure if what I said got through to her, or if she's doing it to keep her job now, but either way I'm happy. I did end up making a page for her, and I went down the line of articles she sent me pointing out the faults of what some of these antivaxxers were saying (it was easy to find that these people were only out for money). I also showed her the nursing reddit and I think that shocked her a bit maybe? So I'm really happy about that, and I hope she'll be healthy as she gets her 1st and 2nd shot. I keep reading stories of teachers literally dying from this strain, and it worries me that she might not make it until the first jab. :( I'm honestly hoping that our governor makes school online for the time being. Oregon hospitals are being filled up right now, and last I read the ones in Portland are renting morgue trucks for the bodies... Aside from that, my life has been a rollercoaster on a personal level. I got my fiance visa to get married in the UK to be with my partner, but our plans for him to come help me have been thrown out the window (due to UK visitors not being allowed entry into the US), and now I have to do everything on my own. It's super daunting. It's such a strange time right now. Good news that seems to somehow bring around worry just as well. I always try to look on the bright side of things, so even if I have to move everything out on my own, then it's one more challenge on myself to improve! And in the end it's a start of a new life! Each hurdle makes you stronger, and I need it for my future plans so I can succeed. :)",

I got the ticket in May when stuff was looking better pre Delta, going for general admission since it was cheaper. I'm fully vaccinated (<ORG>) and tested once a week, not high risk, and everyone was required to show proof of vaccination or a negative covid test, and wear masks except to drink (and everyone actually followed it around me-there weren't many people drinking and the people that were quickly put their mask back on after), and the state I live in is doing alright at the moment. The band I saw isn't incredibly fast-paced so not everyone was screaming and singing the whole time, and it was a fairly small concert. Because of these factors, I assumed it was safe enough before the concert, but stupidly forgot I had general admission tickets. My friend and I stood near the back but soon people filled in behind us and we were surrounded by a crowd of people. I couldn't stop worrying the whole time but given all of these reasons it wasn't enough to waste my money and make my friend leave (who is also fully vaccinated and didn't seem as concerned by the situation). Given all of this, would you say this was a high risk situation or am I most likely okay (obviously I acknowledge there's no way this was 100% safe)? I've seen so many conflicting sources on the severity of the Delta variant and the duration of vaccine protection (some feeling it's only a bit less safe than it was in May for vaccinated people, others ready to go back to barely seeing people) that I can't tell if this is just slightly over-the-top anxiety after not being in a crowd for a year and a half or if going to this concert was a legitimately dumb/selfish thing to do.

To be honest, I'd probably go if it were socially distanced and with proof of vaccine or negative test and masks required, but that's not how it's being done.

I then tested my niece who was vaccinated in June, and to my surprise, she was positive (also <ORG>.) Ater this, I decided to get vaccinated, again.

Going forward though - I can't help but be worried about the fact that my SO has one or two other friends who are unvaccinated and I don't really want this scenario to keep popping up over and over again. In your opinion - would it be unreasonable or self-centred of me to ask my SO that only vaccinated people visit our home from now on? As with everything with Covid-19, this is unchartered territory and I just don't know if it would come across as controlling or unrealistic for me to ask for this. Also - while I personally put my full trust in the vaccine, I don't think it's my place to put pressure on anyone else to get it. So that's another thing that's making me think that maybe it's not a very fair request on my part.",

With that said I still can't hide my utter disgust and contempt for the media for their complete muddling of the message with the vaccines and leaving some people still in the dark. I just had my doctor's appointment today, besides needing to lose a few pounds again (I'm at the gym on most days trying to stay fit), he found no health issues with me whatsoever. Normal blood pressure, normal oxygen levels, I am still considered overweight though (I'm vaxed since April). Still not obese like I was in early 2020 at over 220 pounds. Still at around 190. I asked my primary doctor if he recommends I get an MRNA dose since I was only vaccinated with J and J back in early April. He said it's not necessary right now and I would be notified if anything changed. I kind of wish he said I should or that he said \"I'm not going to stop you but it's not necessary right now.\" I guess part of this frustration just comes from the mixed messaging we are getting from the media. God the media is just such scum in America, I know its horrible to say that but they just give terrible messaging. It's either, \"Covid is a hoax or the Vaccine doesn't work sheeple\" or it's \"We're all going to die\". Leaving that all aside, I wish we had more data on J and J in regard to Delta. It sucks because in early October I am going on a trip with two friends to Florida and they are all vaxed as well. We would be wearing masks on board regardless but still all this talk of the need of boosters and unclear answers from certain experts just leaves me more confused.",

My father and sister have since both tested positive for COVID-19 (my sister with the PCR test, and I believe my father with the antigen test). I was first exposed to them on Wednesday, Sept 15, and my last exposure was Sunday, Sept 19. I exhibited symptoms on Monday, received a PCR test Tuesday morning (administered by a healthcare professional), and received a negative result today.

However, ever since I got covid this past June Ive been experiencing anxiety on a more constant level. I had a really bad attack at work to the point that a coworker of mine took me to the ER. It comes out of nowhere, I cant place any specific triggers. Im not anxious about getting covid again, so its not that. Yesterday I had a really bad day because for the first time I was anxious all day long. Ever since I ended up in the ER I take a clonazepam pill only when Im having an attack. I thankfully started therapy today because I know I need help. Has anyone experienced post covid/long covid anxiety like this? Meaning not necessarily because one is afraid of covid.

She's the first one to bring the virus in our house from her school, my parents tested positive last Friday, I've been trying to isolate in my room while wearing a mask when outside my room and avoiding as much contact as possible. Long story short, this morning I woke up with a scratchy throat with some mucus buildup, did a rapid antigen test, showed positive within 10 minutes. I'm both anxious and disappointed at the same time. I know that we have the best protection we can currently get against this virus and that in theory we should be ok however I'm just afraid of brushing off this virus as a minor thing because loads of people have called this virus \"a bad cold\" or \"just the flu\" only to end up in hospitals or way worse you know? I'm disappointed because I build up this image in my head of the vaccine as a COVID shield that makes you really resistant to COVID and that it's super hard to get infected with it. I was even reading a case of a doctor who had the <ORG> vaccine who spent hours next to COVID patients and the doctor never got COVID. Now that I have it I feel extremely let down especially because I did try to take all the precautionary measure I possibly could. In the end I feel like having the vaccine made no difference to our family being infected because we got it anyways. Breakthrough cases are supposed to be 1 in 500, what are the odds of 3 of them in one household? Anyhow, my symptoms are just now starting, I have a very mild fever and my head feels kinda fuzzy but I expect them to get way worse in the coming days so I hope I don't have to be hospitalized that would be quite terrifying.

Everyone at the concert has to be vaccinated but it will definitely be the kind of show where everyone is tightly packed together and there will be a most pit and crowd surfing.

Now I can't tell if this is totally safe or a super reckless decision. I'm considering going but standing outside of the crowd. I'm going with a friend who will definitely be in the mosh pit area and the idea of leaving them and standing on the sidelines really doesn't sound fun, but I'm kind of terrified of Delta at this point so am considering it. What do people think the risk of an outdoor concert where everyone is vaccinated, but will be tightly packed together is?",

For instance, I came home from work on the 7th and started sneezing and had bad congestion. The first thing that popped into my mind, Covid. So I do an at-home test, on the 13th negative, I kept sneezing so I do the second at-home test Wednesday negative. Still sneezing, went to the clinic that same day and got tested, negative. Still sneezing but now with a sore throat, I wait a few days and get tested that Friday, negative. It went away for a few days and came back and I ended up having a sneezing fit with a slight cough at night. Last Thursday I got a drive-thru PCR test because I haven't stopped sneezing. Got the results back, Sunday negative. Today, still sneezing with a runny nose. I had Covid in October of last year and my first symptom was sneezing. So ever since I've been soooo paranoid about getting it again. Especially since I live with immunocompromised people. I had a blood drawn allergy test earlier this month and it was negative for everything. I'm tired of every time this happens I start trying to play \"connect the dots\" to wonder if I've been exposed. I know those that are vaxxed will get \"mild\" symptoms and are less likely to be hospitalized or die or the long haul is cut by 50%. But I'm not seeing is any mention of is whether those who are vaxxed have any damage such as myocarditis or anything else that happens with those unvaxxed or if it exacerbates problems for those who got Covid a previous time.",

Unfortunately, due to the bungled vaccine rollout in our country as well as the Delta variant that reputation has been destroyed in 2021. We are currently at our absolute worst point since the pandemic started. Today we got 1435 cases, which I know if you're from America or Europe you might roll your eyes at us and think this number is tiny, but to us this is huge and unbelievably demoralising. We're poised to get out of lockdown around October 28th which is when we're predicted to hit 70% double dosed and we'll have more freedoms once we're 80% double dosed. But there is a huge fear of the hospitals being overrun here when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths skyrocketing and having to go back into lockdown even at high vaccination rates. I am feeling so defeated right now, although I am fully vaxxed so its some comfort to be protected. I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire. Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? Thanks.",

We weren't really worried, since she has the best immune system out of all the family members, although she has been badly sick around 4-5 times ever since I'm alive, and I'm 20. To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications. Also, if anybody here had the same symptoms (burning stomach, burning chest or the headache without fever), please feel free to share any tips that helped you or helped someone else you know.

I feel like my mental health is going down the drain, but I just couldn't stop sometimes. The reason I couldn't stop sometimes is because I have this irrational fear that if I stopped, I'd just be putting my head in the sand and falling into a delusional slumber, and I won't be \"awake\" to the threat on the horizon. The past few days have been rough. There's been so many times I was reading a news article or a Reddit thread and felt tears welling up in my eyes, but could not stop as my irrational mind feared I'd then fall into a delusional slumber. I am literally destroying my mental health for the sake of staying \"awake\". I need to stop.

Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health. So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from? Ones that are balanced in their presentation of the facts - not doom and gloom, but not blindly optimistic either. I'll just go to them for my daily Covid updates from now on, and this way I'll stay \"awake\" without all the needless anxiety.",

Double masked, sanitized, the whole bit. Then this week... I researched this place, same size as the other venue. Concert wasn't sold out, looked like plenty of room, good ventilation and the band insisted on masks. The venue ignored the mask rule. Absolutely packed the place. The second band (which was horrible btw) kept encouraging crowd surfing and moshing and it went nuts. But by this time...I've invested 5 hours into this. I think it will be over in a few songs and I don't know that any of these people even want to be around for the actual headliner. But it went on and on. And then the headliner comes on. They are clearly annoyed with the venue but they too encourage \"the energy\" (paraphrasing) and do nothing to stop this. It is stifling, even when I move back from it all.

He is 51, fully vaxxed, had a heart attack 10+ years ago in which he had triple bypass and open heart surgery. He is on medication for life including blood thinners and he has sleep apnea I believe. However he has really made a change in his diet and lifestyle since his heart attack. He exercises almost every day and some could call him a health nut now lol. He signed up today to receive antibodies so hopefully in the next day or so he will qualify and can receive it. My father is my best friend and I feel an immense amount of guilt on my shoulders because I probably was the one who got him sick. If anything happens to him I wont be able to live with myself.

On top of that, my wife's older brother has cancer and is receiving all sorts of immunotherapy to keep the brain, bone and liver cancer at bay. We were supposed to be visiting with him on this trip too. One of my biggest worries through all of the pandemic was the fear of me infecting someone else. Indefinitely don't want to infect her brother. We found out that our family members at our destination are still eating out in restaurants, (with unvaccinated family members), going to exercise classes, and playing group sports. And when my wife talked to them last night, it sounds like they shamed her for considering not making the trip and coaxing her by saying, \"Are you going to hide in your house forever?\", and \"You know there's just going to be another variant after this one, right? It's not going to end, so start living your life\". Disclaimer: we have been living our lives and getting back some normality (eating in restaurants, going to some group events) but we choose to do things when there are not huge crowds and masked.

Yesterday afternoon and into today I started experiencing mild cold symptoms (tickle in throat, very slight cough and very slight stuffy nose).

Not only am I supposed to see my family during the holiday, I also went to a couple holiday parties over the weekend. &amp;#x200B; I had COVID in January and I am fully vaccinated, but have not yet received my booster. I am 28 years old. I am planning on getting tested today. While worrying that I will miss the opportunity to see my family over Christmas is hard enough, if I test positive I would need to tell everyone I saw at work yesterday and over the weekend that I tested positive, and they would then need to get tested and potentially ruin their holidays. I would feel like such an awful person and that all of my friends and colleagues would see me as the one who ruined their Christmas. I really hope it's just a cold, but last time I thought I had a cold I got tested and wound up with COVID. I know this might sound selfish but I almost considered not getting tested just so I wouldn't know if I had it or not, but I know the moral thing to do is find out. Everyone I was at the parties with is vaccinated so hopefully they are okay if I test positive. &amp;#x200B; Am I doing the right thing? What if I had it a month ago and didn't notice, and I test positive because of the antibody and it's just a cold masquerading as COVID symptoms? How do I deal with the burden of potentially ruining the holidays of all my friends, putting others at risk? This is really weighing me down mentally and I could use support.

But today, my sore throat has gotten worse (its uncomfortable to gulp) and I'm sneezing a lot, which apparently isn't listed as a covid symptom but I'm getting really paranoid and I think I've caught covid. I've resorted to natural home remedies like honey ginger tea and drinking warm water for some relief but sneezing with a sore throat is the most painful feeling ever. My father (who is taking this very lightly because he thinks he knows everything) says that it's seasonal because I don't have cough or fever but I really don't want to take a chance and infect my sister. Should I get tested right away or wait for sometime? (though my anxiety wants me to go for it right away)",

Tickets are bought, suitcase is (almost) packed. But now I'm freaking out. People in my home country are not very keen on the COVID measures, to say the least. Very few people wear masks, a lot of the population still isn't vaccinated, QR-codes mostly aren't getting checked, so it could be quite dangerous. Especially for me, because if the worst scenario happens and I'll get COVID - I'm fucked royally, since I don't have an insurance of my home country and they won't even let me in the plane. But the alternative doesn't seem much better, because if I won't fly, I'll be all alone during my holidays (I don't have any friends besides her), and I can await a sad, pathetic and lonely NYE. Not to mention that a good chunk of money will be lost (plane tickets are non-refundable sadly) and don't even get me started about how pissed off my friend would be because of the last moment flaking.

I dont want to risk it to my parents but they say they dont care, its worth the risk to them. I told them thats not the point, you may not care but if something happens I will be the one to deal with it.

I would be destroyed if something happened to them and I havent seen them in years. However, I could cause the same thing by traveling. My gut says I shouldnt. Its not worth the risk.

Covid is a virus that's still circulating worldwide, so testing positive for it isn't something to be totally surprised by. I really dont think there should be a stigma around testing positive for covid in the post-vaccine era.

We shouldn't expect to feel unscathed after all of that. But no matter how hard it gets, try to remember that there's been plenty of positive studies released about the current situation (which yes, we know they have caveats, but their presence is an amazing positive compared to their absence). Also remember that absolutely everything in life is temporary - you won't feel this way forever. (And even if you don't believe it right now, it's still going to be true regardless.) I know this Christmas will be difficult - bad times can be amplified when you feel like you should be feeling good. But if you can, try to step away from the news for a while (all the stories will still be there when you get back) and do something that makes you happy or switch off from the world - eat good food, talk to someone, play a video game, sleep for twelve hours.

I've been stuck in what seems like a time loop without an escape for the last 2 years, what I once thought was a bit of time off from the big city life has turned into 2 years of me essentially living like a sloth.

The city I used to work in/from is about 1.2k km away and, although I had sort of adjusted to this small village vibe I feel like it's just not who I am, then again I'm also somewhat afraid I won't be able to go back and live life as I once did without my loved ones around me, but I just don't feel like I belong here. Back in the day I at least had the excuse of having to live so far away because of work, but now I feel like I want to go back just because: it wouldn't be going back as much as trying in a way to move forward.

I think he may have been exposed before the trip (between 12/9-12/13). Some of the people he was working with tested positive while we were on our trip. Does that timeline sound about right for him to start experiencing symptoms starting 12/24? He woke up Christmas Eve and felt awful full on symptoms of what I thought to be the flu but with a negative COVID test. The next day, he tested twice both with super faint positive lines. 12/26, the positive line was darker. The only other time he would have been exposed was 12/22 when he was with someone that texted and told him they tested positive. But Im not sure if the onset of the symptoms would have happened that quickly. I guess my real question here is: Has anyone gotten COVID (tested positive and everything) and then gotten a negative test within a few days? Also, has anyone experience getting a false positive test OR anyone know if you can test positive even if its just the flu? I took a test and was negative and am feeling fine. I was sure it was just the flu because I am vaccinated against it and hes not. Lastly, and I know this is a dumb question so dont attack me How soon after he tests negative can I go see him? Were both kind of hoping/holding out for him to be negative by NYE. Super selfish, again, dont attack me. Its just wishful thinking and Im just trying to understand a timeline and hear other peoples experiences. Im curious to know if anyone has gotten over it in a shorter amount of time than others. Hes healthy otherwise and vaccinated (which I know means little at this point). Once he tests negative (even if before the recommended 10 days), if I go see him, is there still a huge risk? \\*\\*His symptoms as of now are: on and off fever, fatigue, GI upset (he threw up once and has had weird stomach stuff sometimes otherwise), stuffy nose (new), cough with green phlegm (getting better), headache, body aches he actually looks and sounds good for being sick.

A lot of my co-workers are now out for 2 weeks, and I find myself with all the overtime I could ever want. And just in time, too, because the holiday bills are catching up. 4 of the 6 employees have it, leaving just myself and one night-shift guy. The two of us are the only ones that have been vaccinated.

This Christmas I got my booster and my whole family was not sick and fully vaccinated, save for the small children. Yesterday though I got a distressing text from my aunt, saying that one of the kids came back positive from a pcr test from a week ago. Apparently his dad lied that the negative result from the day before we gathered was from a pcr, and actually came from a rapid home test. (Can I add that I hate how inconsistent and unreliable all these tests seem to be?) The kid apparently had some mild symptoms about a week before christmas and promptly got tested, and the doctor didn't think it was covid. Nobody informed us about this. If I had known I wouldn't have taken the chance What's worse, I went to the gathering with some family friends, and they're much more concerned about this, so they wanted everyone to test negative in some capacity. I did with a home test, but that was only a day after the (at the time unaware) exposure. And I feel so guilty and don't know what to say And what's WORSE worse, is I have both a small new years eve hangout at a friend's house and a convention coming up very shortly. I'm trying to find a pcr test, but everywhere is booked solid. I don't have any symptoms, but I'm so devastated. I can miss out on the hangout, but the convention we've pouted a lot of money and planning into. I have no idea where to even go from here",

Up to this point we'd been (somewhat) suppressing Covid through measures, the vaccine, and immunity gained from having Covid which put an evolutionary pressure on Covid to mutate once again so it can become effective again. If this truly ends up being as mild as the seasonal Flu, shouldn't we encourage this one to be the one that embeds into our society? Until we figure out anti-viral science entirely, isn't that the best we can do? I genuinely fear that being too effective against Omicron might end in a worse variant taking on the pressure, which is what we don't want. I know that this kind of thinking might sound weird though, which is why I'm asking it here.",

I have received some positive response, but also negative response. The response tends to range from \"It's only comparatively better to dying,\" to \"You're selfish for being anti-science and you will kill somebody.\" I've found that some people I know enjoy mentioning their ultra-compliance to self-imposed COVID restrictions and lauding anybody they see not wearing a mask outside when not even close to anyone else. It's like when the anti-mask, anti-vax crowed politicized the virus they made it entirely necessary for anyone opposite them on the political spectrum to adopt eternal draconian COVID tenets as a part of their political identity. Then we have the crowd that never really enjoyed seeing people anyway and have been looking forward to a global catastrophe like this to spur our transition from living life in person to living life virtually in perpetuity. A pandemic ends once everyone is on board with it having ended. If the next mutation literally was a cold I have no doubt that everyone would be pissed at the CDC to say so, there would still be a lot of people (especially social media influencers chasing clout by spouting extremized rhetoric to an impressionable audience) saying that it is selfish to socialize when the virus is still with us, we need to continue to blame others for the virus still being around, you need to wear your mask everywhere, etc. I'm building a strawman, I know, but it is a hypothetical not entirely without some experience to back it up. So all that said, things are eventually going to get better. Is everybody going to be able to accept when it does?

Got the monoclonal antibodies on day 8 and it helped to turn things around. Since folks might ask, I'm 30F, technically obsese BMI, no major pre-existing symptoms aside from borderline high blood pressure/anxiety. However now I'm on week 4 and still feeling weird. Like my heart is still beating erratically at times, I'm having brain fog to the point where I don't remember how do to simple things, I'm thinking slow, depersonalization, depression, and mood swings. I can't sleep, and 3am feels like it might as well be 3pm. I just don't feel like myself. I still have weird nerve sensations in my arms and face and legs. I still get out of breath just walking my dog. I'm just now starting to get taste back but unfortunately everything tastes bad, like sewage, which is almost worse than not being able to taste at all. I'm so incredibly frustrated. I feel so...dumb and tired and its exhausting. I can't see a doctor for another month as they are so backlogged. My question is for anyone else who has gone through this was there anything that helped you get through it? I feel like I'm going crazy and I'm not myself. Any supplements or therapy you can recommend would be helpful. It's frustrating to see people say it's just a cold and are over it in 3 days when I'm still struggling with simple tasks. I'm more determined than ever to lose extra weight since I'm sure that's a contributing factor but I'm hoping there's a light at the end of this tunnel. Thanks!",

They both tested positive today but I ended up being negative even though I was with them. Im staying with my mom now, but I apparently cannot stop crying and worrying about them. I struggle to even brush off the thought of them passing when Im not around. I know it was best for me to be away from them for the time being, but its just difficult to see them in such a different way from their usual healthy selves. Both of them exercise very regularly: my dad is 52 and my sister is 14. My sister has not gotten the booster of course due to her age, but my dad refuses to get it. This part has worried me since the beginning; he does not see the point of getting vaccinated and he frequently goes out. To make things worse, his job requires close contact with people and he relies too much on his immune. Ive tried so many times but I have no idea what else I can do. He doesnt like to listen, but he would usually hear me out if I start crying(according to my sister). I had already left his place in tears leaving him confused, and I am wondering if Im being over dramatic about this. Im glad theyre both choosing to take more precautions and take it more seriously, but I just want them to get better. When I try to look up news/information, I become more overwhelmed and confused as to how deadly this virus/variant is and where we are as a country. And I keep worrying about whether my dads age will affect him too much and how possible is it for both of them to have a good recovery. I understand this is not just your common sickness, but I just cant stop worryingI never knew I would feel this way, especially when winter break was supposed to be relaxing for all of us.",

Fast forward one co worker has tested positive and now my sister has as well (unrelated to my place of work, she and her roommate caught it from someone over Christmas). Im honestly very nervous and people all around me keep talking about omicron and how all of us are just getting it left and right.

I spoke to my therapist about my struggles to find people I can connect well with and she told me because I'm not willing to do zoom calls I'm probably not gonna get anywhere towards making new friends for a long time. And one of my closest friends got upset at me for going to EDC Orlando last month and going to Disneyland with my mom last week. I was scared to even post that I went to edc Orlando a month ago because my friend wouldn't approve of it. I still have a super hard time convincing myself that 2022 will be any better.

Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.",

I decided to get tested that same day and got my results about 36hrs later, and it was negative. At the time, I was pretty fatigued and I felt like I was going to fall asleep during dinner and I had a weird slimy feeling in my throat, so nothing major. These \"symptoms\" haven't really changed, so I decided to test myself yesterday with an antigen rapid test kit and it came out positive. So what should I even believe? The PCR test results was 3 days after the gathering, and the Antigen Rapid Test kit I did was yesterday. One could be false positive and the other one could be false negative. Should I assume the Rapid Test kit is wrong since I always hear they are inaccurate? Regardless, I'm still quarantining myself for 2 weeks.",

I (24 F, 3X vaxxed) went a family gathering on 12/24 (my first family event since COVID began), started feeling sick on 12/26. By 12/27 I had a full-blown sore throat, fever, chills, &amp; difficulty breathing. Standing to do dishes became impossible. Found out on 12/29 that *4* family members (of maybe 15 total in attendance) had tested positive since the gathering, all starting to feel sick on 12/26 as well, &amp; they happen to be the ones I spent the most time near. At this point, my symptoms change every day - today is headache, trouble breathing, runny nose, etc. I've had pretty much every symptom except loss of taste or smell. Testing kits are non-existent where I live at this point. Earliest testing appt. was 12/29 for a PCR test through Project Baseline (Rite-Aid) &amp; I received my results this evening - negative for COVID. At first I was relieved, but I'm having a hard time believing that what I'm experiencing is anything but COVID when A) I was in an environment where somebody was clearly infectious &amp; in close contact with family, &amp; B) I've never felt an illness quite like this in my life. Seriously, everything feels like an effort! I've never quite struggled to breathe like this (Also, negative for flu) The earliest testing appointment anywhere near me is 1/6. I intend on testing again but have little hope for answers, honestly, thinking this is pretty far out from exposure date. How should I interpret this negative result? Am I super paranoid or was the time frame in which I got tested too soon/late? All thoughts welcome!",

About 3 weeks ago my husband (m31) tested positive for Covid. He was very low on energy and slept ALOT for about a week. Finally, we noticed his oxygen saturation was dropping off and on. On day 7 of him being positive, his oxygen saturation dropped to 83. So, we had him sent to the hospital via ambulance. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days. After a day and a half he was bumped from 5 liters of oxygen to a heated high flow 50 liters. He stayed on that for about 3 days and then they slowly decreased. He was discharged about a week ago, but he still has to use oxygen when he sleeps and sometimes throughout the day. His PCP says he needs to stick with it for at least another month. My husband is very determined to stop using it as much and he is pushing himself. I understand he doesnt want to use it forever, but his doctor says it will take one day at a time. I am hopeful that he will be able to come off of it soon, but I fear that my husband is rushing it. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!",

And now I'm so scared I will have to do the same, but still trying to be positive and manifest a good outcome. The day before Christmas, my own dad tested positive for covid, had typical cold symptoms, said he felt fine otherwise. I bought him an oximeter and yesterday he started feeling worse and his blood oxygen level was at 42% so I brought him to the hospital. He called me and sounded so scared and confused and asked me to come pick him up and bring him to the hospital. His healthcare team said it's an extreme case of covid and there is a high probability that he may be intubated. If he maxes out on the oxygen through his cannula, he will move to CPAP, and then to a vent. The doctor said he's now at a point where patients typically start to gradually improve, or take a sharp decline and have to end up on a vent, which has a 50% mortality rate for my dad's age. Thankfully his oxygen level is staying above 90% while he's got the cannula in and is thinking more clearly, etc. It could really go either way right now. I can't go see him, he can't really talk on the phone, I couldn't even wait with him in the ER waiting room. Just had to hug him real quick, tell him I love him, and then leave. Anyone else been here or had a family member in this position? Any tips to help him not panic to keep his breathing steady? Any tips for me and what I should be asking the doctors, etc? He is unmarried and I am the eldest child. I just can't imagine losing my father so young. He is only 50 and I am 26. Could use some words of encouragement and positive recovery stories.",

I lived my life like I had no fear of getting it anytime soon; nothing crazy just went to a small bar a couple of nights. Come Jan 1st, and I wake up with a slightly stuffy nose. Later that night, my sister, who I spent every second of the trip, tested positive for covid. After that moment I became extremely worried that my congestion was covid and it only got worse with flying back. I tested on the 2nd after my flight and my antigen came back positive. I freaked out. Can I have it again after only getting it 20 days ago, or is it just a false positive? Extra concerned as my antigen test on the 24th was negative and now my at-home one is positive.

Immediately upon finding this out i took a rapid test and it was negative, and then today i took a PCR and am waiting for results. My mother with whom i'm staying with is severely immunocompromised (like had open heart surgery a year ago and one of her lungs doesnt work properly). So despite having been in in very close contact with her i am now distancing from her and everyone else in the house and wearing a mask. Then, today we discovered that a family member who was here on the 1st just tested positive on a rapid test today. So, i have a couple of questions cause we're all kind of freaking out right now. 1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)? 2) It is even possible for me to have transmitted covid to this family member who was here on the first? If i was carrying it, my time of contact with the virus would have been only 4 days prior. Is this enough time for me to have then transmitted it to someone else? 3) What exactly is safe to do in my house? Right now i am confining myself to either my bedroom (mask off) or in an adjacent bonus room (with a mask on). This room is fairly large, and a couple of people in the house pass through it a few times a day, generally passing about 15-20 feet away from me. How likely is it that i can pass the virus to them while being in this room, with a mask on? Thanks, appreciate any help i can get. Note: everyone in my family has 2 vaccines, my mother has had 3.

I'm constantly trying to make sense why we're one of the only countries in full lockdown, and it seems at least partially due to our low ICU (critical care) capacity, meaning the potential for our hospitals to become overwhelmed is far higher than in other countries. Now, I've clung to the hope that pandemics in the end will end once enough people have contracted the virus / become vaccinated, but the following article worries me a bit: [[url] It says that getting the viruss reproductive number down to one is just the bare minimum for earning the endemic classification (instead of a pandemic), and the moment it stops being a threat will differ per country and depends on factors like hospital / ICU capacity. So since we had kind of a healthcare crisis even before the pandemic, I'm very worried that we might be stuck with restrictions way longer than other countries. Even before covid, in 2018 we had to postpone some operations due to a heavy flu season. The government planning \"long term strategies\" where we will indefinitely move large gatherings to the summer and \"stay low\" during the winter doesn't help either... Can anyone give some reassurance / thoughts? TLDR; I'm worried the problem with limited critical care in the Netherlands will keep us from moving beyond this crisis",

I live in a southern state that does little to nothing in the university system to mitigate the spread of COVID. Up until this point I have not gotten it by wearing a mask in class despite being one of the only ones to do so and limiting my time on campus. That being said, last semester I somehow got mono and missed 4 weeks of school due to having post viral fatigue and also battled a kidney infection at the same time. The stress that put on me in terms of making up my schoolwork was crazy. I was thinking that maybe just maybe this semester COVID would die down even more but the transmission rate along with the new guidlines on isolation just seem like a recipe for disaster in an environment when people already dont care. In addition one of my classes is 3 hours long. Thats a long time to be exposed to people. I understand that its basically inevitable Im going to get it and whatever Im just feeling dissapointed and hopeless and dont want the stress of being sick to take me down again. Im also just frustrated that everyone seems to have given up on trying to control COVID even just a little bit. I know Im healthy otherwise and I wouldnt probably be severely ill due to be vaccinated and boosted its just annoying how it seems everyone has resigned to it.",

The moment I stepped into my tiny studio I started crying hysterically, and I haven't stopped crying every few hours since. Yesterday I found out my sister , who I spent a lot of time with, tested positive. And then I started getting sick. I'm pretty sure I have COVID and the testing tommorow will likely confirm that. And I'm so scared , not as much about being sick but the isolation. It feels like somebody ripped out a chunk of my heart and Im overwhelmed by everything. Schools starting again and I have assignments to do, I'm so hungry, and I need my meds renewed, but all I can think of is how scared I am of being alone. I think I got traumatized by past instances of being alone during lockdown and I emotionally can't do it this time around. There's also a curfew which makes things even worse. I can't even distract myself with TV or movies, I feel no desire to do anything. On top of that many of my friends are suicidal and I'm so so scared that I'll lose someone. I live in Quebec and everything is so fucked, I feel completely trapped and the walls are closing in on me. This cycle of being able to live on my own= there being another lockdown = having a mental breakdown and moving in with my parents = moving back out to the city I normally live in , makes me feel like nothing will ever improve. I have a pet who needs me to care for him but I can't, I'm struggling and I need help. Please if anyone is going through the same thing or knows some tips to cope please help, I feel like I can't breathe and idk how much longer I can do this,",

Right now RT-qPCR appointments are available 7-30 days in advance.

I'm in a sports society and they're already talking about going to clubs when the term starts so I feel like when I go back I'm going to almost 100% catch it either from my sports team, from my friends or just in general from being in a packed uni environment.

Our government made a vaccin passport and we cannot go to restaurants or do interior activities without it. I consider myself a very responsible citizen and I would like your opinions in a polite manner. I am here to have clearer thoughts. My main concerns are: 1. I dont feel the obligation since we dont have any known health issues and we do not live or work with old people. 2. We all got what we think is covid before tests were available (jan-feb 2020) I had all the symptoms including loss of smell and taste and it was the worst flu of my life. I never got that sick in my entire 35 years. Husband and kids less than me. All my surroundings were very sick. My nurse friend said at the clinic they has lots of unknown cases, doctor couldnt figure out what it was.. and antibiotics didnt work. So many people got it. 3. I wear my mask and keep social distancing and whatever my Quebec (canada) government is asking. Even though I do not follow their logic because of their lack of transparency and open debate. 4. Lots of scientiste, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, are against what is happening and the obligation to get vaccinated. So I do have a trust issue I never get my news from facebook or social media. I do know how to read scholarly articles. 5. Lets not lie about the fact that pharmaceutical companies are getting richer 6. Vaccins have to fo through many years of testings (5-7) so I am scared about long term effect 7. In Israel they started the 4th shot so vaccin is not fixing the problem?! 8.

I know the pandemic will end eventually, but with more variants most likely coming soon, Im not sure if itll ever end. Im sorry, I had a hard time at work and a friend of mine didnt e-mail me back over a month. I want this pandemic to end badly, but maybe Ill just have to get used to the pandemic and wont anything like maybe until 2023 or more. I hope this post doesnt get deleted, if it did, Im giving up.",

For my second I was really sick for 3 days with what I describe as a combination of the flu and an awful hangover (103.5 fever, chills, aches, headache, nausea etc). Because of this I have been hesitant getting the booster shot. I got an antibody test couple weeks ago, right before the holidays. To my shock my antibodies are still &gt; 2500. To my knowledge I have never contracted covid. I was exposed on Christmas, I tested negative, but my wife tested positive. Had another test 5-6 days after second exposure and tested negative again. I felt fine throughout the week I was exposed from my wife and before that as well. Considering all of this, I'm thinking of waiting until they come out with a new booster that includes new variants. I don't want to go through getting that sick again without an added benefit. Any thoughts?",

There's talk abt reduced symptom *severity*, and some vague studies on antibody levels, but rn the messaging is very much \"you'll still catch it, you'll still get sick, but at least it won't be *as* bad.\" and sometimes even the I know that a lot of this is too new to have super solid information on but it seems almost eerie that I'm not finding *anything*. A lot of \"well, we *think* it *should* work,\" which...doesn't feel encouraging. I'll be honest, I'm just as if not more worried about *any* symptomatic infection, mild or not than I am about the risk of getting severe symptoms (basically, even just getting sick *at all* poses a list of logistical nightmares in my current situation). Add that to having terrible side effects after my second dose, a very strong phobia of nausea (which I got) and a moderate phobia of fevers/chills (which I *definitely* got, oh, god) and the worry about having to either take extra time off work from it depending on how long symptoms last...I'm genuinely considering cancelling my appt tomorrow. Most likely scenario I see rn is I get boosted, deal with *that* again, and then still end up catching covid, having to quarrantine, etc and my only consolation is that I don't get *as* sick. I know the official line is \"always get boosted!!!\" but I need some help convincing myself because the thought of going through what I went through on the second shot again is more than I can handle rn.",

My workplace has undergone a huge transformation, which means that the default model is working from home. You can work in the office for mental health reasons (such as if you live alone). I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room. In 2019, I met a guy, sparks flew between us, and we were going to meet up. He lives in a different country. It has just fizzled out. My self esteem has plummeted as my weight has rocketed. Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office. Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit. Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement. And I'm symptomatic, which has led to me losing my voice so I can't even speak to anyone on the phone. Which is not good as I've been on and off crying since I got back. And my throat is so sore, hurts to cough, hurts to swallow. I'm just at the point where I'm really not coping.

No fever, loss of smell, chills, fatigue, or anything like that. I was double-vaccinated at the time, am now boosted because appointments were hard to snag. Testing appointments are also hard to get, even for rapid tests, and I got one yesterday (January 5th) at a pharmacy. The pharmacist only swabbed my nose. The test came back negative, but I still have the cough (though again, no other symptoms). I can't get another test until Monday at the earliest, because there are no available appointments.

And we had a million cases in 1 day in the USA which I never thought would even be possible. I also spoke to my therapist about it, and she told me that people in the trans community are very covid cautious. And that the reason why a lot of people in that community didn't try returning to normal over the summer was because of a lack of social support from their families. She basically told me that for now I should try a different zoom group to find new friends. And I've tried zoom groups and had pretty bad luck with them in general, and one of the zoom groups I went to criticized me when I said I was thinking of going to Florida for spring break last year, and even after I got vaccinated. And then there's the issue of mask mandates, I have a very hard time seeing how my area will get cases low enough to remove the mask mandate now since they're goal for removing the mandate is currently focused on cases and not hospitalizations.

We went through the courts and my brilliant, affectionate, funny, wonderful 13 year old son now lives with me, with only a few days every few weeks at his mom's, which he's actually not quite happy about. As part of the agreement, he spent a few days with her over New Years. He left the 30th and was supposed to come back the 4th. During the night 31st--&gt;1st, he calls me at 2am, panicking: his mom tested positive with a home test for COVID, and he tested negative. The earliest I could pick him back up was the 2nd, and he isolated as much as possible between then and when I could pick him up. Upon returning to my place we were meticulously cautious. He's confined in his room, even for his meals, - he doesn't step outside except to use the washroom which I clean after every use. I try to keep it light, stay - both masked - more than 2m from each other to discuss his homework and read stuff to each other. The days are passing and he remains 100% symptoms free. I'm assuming he was exposed right when he went over there, on the 30th, which would make it day \"1\", and would make today day \"9\", although I'm assuming that the most cautious scenario would be to consider the last contact with her (Jan 2nd) as day \"1\", which would only make today day \"6\". Here's the thing though: it's start to weigh on both him and me, and the idea that we couldn't even have the week-end to do anything together is making him be quite down. Whether we consider today day 6 or day 9, he's still rigorously symptoms-free. Can you help me think through the risks here?

My covid anxiety was finally gone in 2021 (I'm in Canada, we got our numbers so low) and now it's back full force to the point that I have a panic attack every day. My parents are anti-vax and are friends with even more severe militant anti-vaxers who are also conspiracy theorists. I am an adult who lives alone apart from them. My mom has had two vaccines and my dad is unvaccinated. I've had nightmares and anxiety attacks about my dad dying from covid since the beginning of the pandemic. He refuses to get vaccinated no matter what I say, how I beg or how I plead. On new years, my parents partied with their antivax friends. Last night I had yet another nightmare in light of omicron. Today my dad tested positive. I have not been able to calm down. I've been crying, panicking, the whole nine yards. Nothing I Google regarding an unvaccinated person's chances against the virus is comforting. I'm terrified my dad is going to die. I'm not ready to lose my dad. I just lost my uncle to cancer a month ago. My dad is 60 years old and he's very healthy and fit for his age, but I'm still worried because of his age. Currently he has no symptoms and my mom keeps telling me I'm being alarmist and ridiculous for freaking out so much but I keep panicking about my dad suddenly dying in his sleep or it suddenly turning worse really fast. Additionally, my parents were likely exposed on Dec 30-31 and on Jan 2 my mom insisted on dropping off a bag of food at my place. She's fully vaxxed and I had her stand outside (open doorway) to hand me off the bag, she wore a mask and I wore two masks (I'm triple vaxxed) and yet I'm still absolutely petrified ill develop symptoms at any moment. Literally any words of comfort or something could help rn, all my friends say is \"I'm sorry\" like my dad is already dead and I freak out even more.",

We eventually texted a bit, but then her lack of communication and respect of autism caused issues. She visited the school again, and I was going to see her, but again lack of communication. We talked later that night and she said \"I said hi to the teachers, I roamed\" and I got very frustrated. And since then, I wanted to meet that girl. I just wrote letters and shit, and it's not doing a thing. It's making me think that I should've met her in the past, where she would've been more nice rather than have her watch me kill myself in a global pandemic. I just wish we talked properly. That's all. She thinks there's no COVID in her eyes. Oh speaking of that, a dysfunctional family and other environments. On some days everything would be good, some days would be shit.

Nothing severe so far, just congestion and a cough, for the most part. I have asked them about other symptoms and other than some difficulty smelling due to the fact that their nose is stuffed up, there's nothing else to report. They're recently boosted. I'm almost five months out from my second dose, so it's nearly my turn to get boosted too. I have congestion here and there, but mostly I'm just aching and exhausted, and I kept getting headaches on and off, though they seem to have stopped for now. I work from home, but it's been almost impossible to get anything done in the past few days because I'm just so tired all the time. I know we can write this off as something non-COVID, but I'm trying to be realistic here and someone at my family member's job is out with a confirmed case. They were definitely exposed, at the very least. Getting tested is next to impossible, though I'm looking. When I heard the news about how contagious omicron is, I kind of just... accepted the reality that getting it was a definite possibility, even as a vaccinated person. But now that it's looking really likely, especially when I'm reading that experts are saying to assume COVID before you assume the flu or a cold... I'm pretty scared. I tried to get boosted, but until a few days ago, it was too early. I'm trying to stay away from places like the subreddit where people discuss their confirmed cases exclusively. It's a great resource but at this point it's just going to scare the shit out of me, as it's more likely to attract people with more notable (aka, more symptomatic) cases.",

So, if you've read my previous posts, you'll know my situation of living with antivax parents and how that has affected me mentally speaking.

No side effects, apart from pain in the place of the injection. It's been more than 24 hours, so I guess I'm good on that side. It honestly feels surreal. I didn't even plan for it to happen that way, it was a spur of the moment decision. But now something troubles me. I fear my family may get to know it, and I don't feel the same having to hide it from them. I fear I was being impulsive and the best choice was to wait. I try to tell myself I had little choice, with Delta increasing the cases in my town, but it doesn't feel that way. There's also the fears theorists have put on my head, like infertility or altered DNA. Did I do it right? Or I should've just wait? I know it sounds silly, but I'm really second guessing myself.

There are so many questions I realized I couldn't answer with certainty when discussing Covid with them. I was hoping to get some help for answers here. 1. If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? For example, if I am vaccinated and my cousin is not, we both meet my uncle who has Covid and are exposed. Since I am vaccinated, is there a higher chance that my body rejects the virus and so I don't become a carrier and spread it to others? If so, how much higher are the odds (if all other things are equal)? 2. If you had Covid previously, do you have a lesser chance of spreading it? Do Covid survivors have some immunity, so when they are exposed to someone with Covid, they have a much lesser chance to becoming a carrier. Since I had Covid AND I am vaccinated, am I much less likely to be a carrier now? Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but these questions are about the general odds. It seems like the narrative is constantly changing so it gets confusing. For example, now the news seems to be saying that even if your vaccinated you're going to get Covid, but you'll have milder symptoms. Or that you can spread it almost as easily as someone who is not vaccinated, etc. It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this. All news that I've been hearing are very vague with this type of stuff and I don't know why.",

I have several friends who have diminished or altered smell/taste after having COVID and I would be absolutely devastated if that happened to me. I'd feel bad if I had to distance from my mom just because she went out. Normally I'd think the risk is probably pretty low, but with numbers this high I'm not sure what to think. Any advice?

I have lost over 60 pounds in the last few months and am going strong with weight loss and healthier eating/daily exercise. But my weight being so high is still clearly putting me at higher risk. Additionally I have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease that is an additional risk factor, especially combined with obesity. I have been attempting to get healthier to address both of these concerns but I am scared that this will not be enough and catching COVID could kill me. I have had an overwhelming feeling of impending doom. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this anxiety/ have any perspective on this situation?

I started feeling sick this last Tuesday (1/4) at work.

As of right now, other than the occasional cough and some congestion, I'm feeling a lot better, and even those are WAY better than where I was at on Tuesday. Obviously, I want to get back to work, but I'm concerned about how short the quarantine my work is requiring is, when even the doctor was saying I should quarantine for at least 10 days. I, luckily, didn't infect anyone at work, and I'm concerned that I might do so if I return early. Because of the nature of the job, there's a high likelihood that, if I'm still contagious, they'll also get it. Any advice?

We also wear 3 masks at once (I know Im a bit insane lol), including a KN95, a good quality cloth mask, and a surgical mask on top. We are planning to have our wedding in spring 2023, and Im afraid if we wait too long to book a venue then we wont be able to get the date we want. I could reschedule until March, but Im worried they wont have anymore space for the date we want. What do you think we should do? What would you do? I REALLY dont want to get covid lol.",

The main thing causing me anxiety is getting the vaccine as I have not done that yet as I constantly look up things about it and see that some of the side effects could include heart problems, GBS, or potentially blood clots and strokes. I'm a young fit male early 20's trying to rationalize that those won't happen to me but it is always a chance, more so with COVID. I'd hate to get the vaccine and have severe complications or worse but I also don't want to take a chance with COVID itself. I know it sounds quite self absorbed but essentially this is what I am going through. Mostly all of my friends around me have the vaccine and its reassuring but I'd hate to be the one that experiences something severe. Anyone have advice regarding anxiety and/or maybe supporting evidence about the rareness of these side effects in the vaccines, what they were linked to or caused by?",

One of them had symptoms since Wednesday and showed up anyway. It's just a matter of time before someone else is positive. There are also many cases amongst 2nd and 3rd year students, last week a few students who were close contacts showed up to class anyway (without getting tested). Today all 3rd year students were sent home, they are considered a cluster. I wasn't there thankfully but that's what my classmates told me. I don't want to go there catch covid and take the subway / bus and the end of the day and spread it even more. They refuse to let us work from home, even though we only need our laptops to work. Subways are packed like crazy of course. It's driving me crazy, it feels like they are just waiting for the whole school to turn into a cluster to close it. I feel bad for not wanting to go, I don't want to get in trouble, but at the same time I also think the school should take proper action before it's too late maybe not close the whole place but my class is pretty high risk right now so we shouldn't have to go anymore at this point.

It's followed with more doom and gloom theories like the idea that \"masks don't work\" and \"vaccines don't work\", etc. There has been this idea that some Covid was a magical, mysterious new force that could evade all attempts to stop it. But it's not. It's dangerous, sure, but it is just a virus. It isn't \"trying to find a way around our immunity\" or \"going after certain populations\". It isn't waiting for prayers to stop it. It's stupid. It's not even a life-form. It's a piece of biological machinery dependent entirely on the living to do anything at all. It's a gear...not the engine. Masks slow it down, quarantine slow it down more, vaccines much more than that and so on. But to really go back to pre-covid19 days we would need not only vaccines, herd immunity and basic safety measures, but also a way to \"Tamiflu\" the virus if caught in the early days. All these steps together should bring us back to levels and severity more consistent with a typical flu season. And if instead of regular covid shots along with our flu shots we could get a LIFETIME immunity, well that would just be a ridiculously good outcome. Omicron is typically a milder version on an individual basis than other variants and while it is spreading too quickly to be safe to society at large, it will create a lot of herd immunity.

I live with a family member that I would prefer not to expose to the virus. I've been quarantined for the last week and I've tested at home, and was negative 5 days (around what was the mean day of symptom onset) after exposure. I've had COVID before, and I got sick around 5 days after COVID exposure the last time. I'm triple vaccinated now, too. I still feel like I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop. Every twinge in my back, sneeze, and throat tickle puts me on edge (I'm in New England so the air is insanely dry right now, both outside due to the bitter cold and inside due to heating). I know I'm not out of the possible incubation period, but I just feel like I can't be so lucky as to have direct exposure and not get sick this time. Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the vaccine, but it feels like with so many breakthrough cases that I should just expect to get reinfected. I've read booster efficacy sits around 75%. I feel like that should be more reassuring than what my current state of mind has me feeling. I used to feel a sense of comfort, having been vaccinated and having \"hybrid\" immunity, etc, but this surge of Omicron has really crushed that feeling. I know it's milder, which I'm happy about. It's just that this moment we're living through is incredibly unnerving. I'm essentially just venting and trying not to catastrophize. Thanks for reading.",

Like, really adventurous, even as a kid. I relished the opportunity to venture outside my comfort zone and try new foods, including new applications of the few ingredients I didnt like. I even loved pungent foods - washed rind cheese, jars of anchovies, fermented soybeans, you name it. Fast forward almost two years since the pandemic and I hardly recognise this version of myself anymore. I tend to gravitate towards the same four vegetables over and over again, unless other vegetables have been pureed or cooked beyond recognition. Most textures repulse me to the extent where I will cycle through the same meals which usually tend to be on the blander side. I grew up in a multicultural household so for me to be eating food so lacking in flavour (curries are now well and truly out of the question) oddly feels like Im losing part of myself, which is consistent with how many of us are feeling at the moment. Ive been through a lot of major changes over the past 24 months, pandemic notwithstanding, and as someone with depression and anxiety, this may well relate to that. That said, I was wondering if anyone else has observed significant changes to their eating habits, and whether this has coincided with any major changes in circumstances and wellbeing.

I was told (before losing healthcare) delaying may result in needing a liver transplant, but don't know how likely this actually is. I was able to start treatment a couple months ago (a year later than planned) and now they want me to come in and do tests to see how it's working, like ideally in the next week. However, I live outside the service zone of my parents' insurance, and I would be traveling to the Bay from LA when currently omicron is spiking here. Both my partner and I work in schools where a shitton of students and faculty have tested positive or been exposed, specificallytoday. My father has stage 3, almost stage 4 cancer and has been doing weekly radiation and my mother works in-person, so I don't want to expose the household further. Paying to stay anywhere else isn't financially feasible (actually, even traveling up there by bus or plane will almost put me in debt right now) and I don't have anyone to ask in the area to stay with, and also don't want to expose anyone else in case I catch COVID in LA or during travel. (I could literally travel up there, do my appointment, and come back down, but it would be very hard on my body, and I would feel terrible without visiting when I feel like I have limited time left with my dad..) I will be aging out of my parents' insurance this year anyway and plan to be either under student healthcare or my partner's plan (insurance marriage, lol) by the end of the year. I'm thinking of holding off on taking care of my medical needs until the end of the year when I can hopefully switch to LA-based services. I was wondering if this sounds... logical given the situation right now, or if I am being too paranoid. I understand my condition would potentially suffer if I'm forgoing tests that would detect something abnormal right now, but I'm just too scared (and broke, tbh) to travel up there and potentially expose my parents.

We're in a room that's probably about 80sqft, so a small and windowless space. We're both always masked(me with a kn95, her a surgical mask) and vaxxed(I'm also boosted). The reason it's possible is that she had a cold over the winter break that she could never get tested for, but might have been covid and that showed on the PCR. Her rapid test for re-entering school on Monday was negative. She's supposed to take another rapid test on Saturday, so we'll see how that goes. I'm not especially worried for myself. I'm triple vaxxed, 31, and healthy. My dilemma comes from living with my 70 year old mother and 66 year old, diabetic father. They're also triple vaxxed, and my dad's diabetes is actually pretty controlled, but obviously I want to protect them. Aside from masking around the house, and staying confined to my room as much as possible, is there anything I can do? In addition, because I'm triple vaxxed, currently negative, and asymptomatic, I'm still going into work, where I'm masked and staying inside our office, unless asked to cover a class because they're very short-staffed, unfortunately. Anything I can do to keep the kids safe? Any extra precautions I should take? I know the CDC doesn't recommend quarantine, just masking, is that.... fine?

I do, however, have a double ear infection, something I haven't had since I was a kid. I was told this was likely due to a different illness clogging my eustachian tubes and preventing my sinuses/ears from draining properly, leading to infection. They said COVID couldn't be ruled out as the cause, despite the negative result. So take that as a cautionary tale for post-illness, I guess. If your ears hurt, see a doctor. But my question isn't \"did COVID do this to me\" because there's really no way of knowing if I had it or not at this point.

Regardless of where they are in the political spectrum - right, left or center. So it's safe to say that the oil lobby will want to return to normalcy and they wield a lot of power. They want travel to come back, people to get into their cars and go places, and the manufacturing economy to start chugging along at full speed. Then you have the entities that actually benefit hugely in this pandemic phase: companies like amazon that have obliterated retail and keeping people out of malls only helps their business. Pharma companies that are rolling in cash not just for vaccines but for anything people want to take that they think might help them. I'm sure there are many others. When things go back to normal, amazon is going to see their record profits return to normal. So isn't the question - who has more power, the ones benefiting from this new normal, or those that want it to return to previous times?",

Ive had a few close contacts/exposures over last week and this week, the most recent one being Monday. I have a 6 month old baby so just for piece of mind really, I tested every day since. On Thursday morning I tested using an On/Go rapid test and it came back positive but with a really faint line, faint enough that I had to shine my light on it to see it. Trying not to panic, I wanted to be extra sure so I worked (from home) waited 8 hours and then took the other test out of that same box. This time, the positive line showed up a little more visible but at about minute 7 I noticed that the line was half gone. And by minute 10 it had completely disappeared. Confused and anxious, I took a different brand test (Quidel Quick View) and that came back negative after the ten minutes. I was feeling a little manic that day from all of the confusion and ended up digging that test out of the trash after about an hour and it looked like there was a positive line there, but it wasnt there the first time. Friday morning I tested negative and also Saturday I tested negative. Throughout this whole time I never had any symptoms except for a baseline morning headache and a bit of a dry throat that tends to go away by mid morning. I am currently waiting on PCR results to come back but they wont be here til Monday. What are your thoughts? Has anyone experienced this? Thanks in advance!!",

This may be the sole reason why this variant is the worst one yet. It can infect you no matter what vaccine you got, or how many times youve been vaccinated. An omicron specific vaccine would likely help, but our vaccine makers are too slow right now with this creation, and should have started making it back in November when this was discovered. It evades almost all immunity provided by vaccination. It does not evade T cells, however, and I personally feel we were really lucky we got away scot free with that. Nevertheless even being sick with Covid is not acceptable if youre boosted. 2. Transmissibility: this variant is almost as contagious as measles. You can get it even being masked with a cloth mask next to one other person, outside. To sum it up, this variant nearly brought us back to March 2020. We got really lucky, but we may not be so lucky the next Time. Currently, this is the worst variant of the pandemic. Virulence is moot when the other factors come into play.",

After speaking with my manager I was put on Medical Leave of Absence which allowed me to keep and self pay for my healthcare. My wife and I went into hard lockdown. Mostly deliveries of food, although I did do a little shopping at TJ's when they used to have senior hours. Fast forward to June of 2021. The grocery store called and said I either had to return to work or resign. This was a corporate wide policy. I resigned. The COBRA premiums were $790 per month. While I still had some savings, this was really beyond my budget. In September I got a job with a very small company. I work as an electromechanical tech fixing receipt printers. I have never removed my mask while in the building. Lunch? In my car. Sip of tea? Step outside. Snack or fruit? Step outside. On the 7th of this month one of my colleagues was in the same room as I and started to have a coughing fit. He ripped his mask OFF and coughed for 10 or 15 seconds. It must have been in that brief moment that he infected me. When I showed to work the next he was not in. I scheduled a PCR test and thankfully was able to schedule one for that Friday. When I woke that morning I had some unexplainable aches and pains. I was at work, but following my test appointment I went home. That night I had coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and a slight fever. It was either Thursday or Friday that I infected my wife. She has similar symptoms, but she has also lost senses of taste and smell. I cannot say just how angry I am at me colleague.

I just find myself constantly reminiscing about good memories, which makes me feel a little bit better. This pandemic has ruined my mental state and led me to burnout. I mean, the constant loneliness and boredom FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR would make anyone insane. At first I loved quarantine because I thought this was just gonna last until 2021 and there was no school. But now with online classes and the pandemic still going on? It just, makes me feel burnt out. There could've been so many opportunities for me if it wasn't for this pandemic. Back before the pandemic, I was this energetic, smart, and promising kid full of potential, but now, I'm this miserable guy who does nothing but browse the internet all day. It's unbelievable how things have gotten this bad in just a span of one or maybe two years. Despite all of that, I still feel optimistic, that one day once all of this is over, I'm gonna be able to go back to the places that I've always wanted to go back to, get more opportunities, and of course, rebuild my life to the life that I had before the pandemic, but this time an improved one, as I've learned a lot about life during the pandemic, so that's a plus I guess. But until then, I guess I'm gonna try my best to fill the dark void of my life. In other words, I'm gonna try to be more productive and get more hobbies, with the good memories I've made in the past motivating me.",

Right now, she lives in our old house, far away from where I'm staying right now, but I used to visit her and stay with her for a few weeks from time to time before the pandemic.

I swear I could hear her tossing stuff in her house, the call went on for half an hour. She eventually just hung up.

I see posts like these and I get confused (the blue and yellow figures are today's report on deceased vaccinated/boosted; red figures are deceased unvaccinated) [[url] According to the Dept. of Health of Puerto Rico: **91.9%** of the total population has at least a dose of the vaccine, **80.2%** of which are fully-vaccinated. We had been doing great before Omicron (keeping infection rate at 2% I believe... it is now at 30+%). [[url] There is so much information going on that I am having trouble making sense of it. Essentially people are worried that vaccines are causing issues or not working or something else is going on because these posts show more vaccinated people dying than unvaccinated. I would like to figure out how that translates with the high vaccinated population we have. Let me do some math (please correct this if it's wrong; I'm not great at math and am using a formula I found online): If we have 80.2% (**2,509,034** people) fully vaccinated, of which 15 died today, that means: **(15/2,509,034) x 100% =** **0.00000597839** fully-vaccinated people died today out of the total of fully vaccinated crowd. If we have 19.8% (2,509,034 - 3,076,212 of total people = **567,178)** unvaccinated, of which 6 died today, that means: **(6/567,178) x 100% =** **0.00001057868** people unvaccinated died today of the total of the unvaccinated crowd.

However, she thinks that is some kind of shield that makes her more strong against any virus and now doesn't take any precautions at all. No more masks, works at a convenience store where she could be infected by anyone, and now she has decided to take a couple hour road trip in a closed car with someone who just last week sounded a lot like she had the virus, but wasn't tested, so it's hard to know. I just want to be able to relax and forget about it. I've done everything I can to protect myself, but with her constantly exposing herself to the virus, it's hard. And no, I can't move or throw her out as we both share the rent and neither can afford to pay the rent alone, especially me who has gotten ill with other problems and lost my insurance. I've tried convincing her, but she always says \"You got to die sometime.\" and brushes me off. I'm actually surprised she at least went and got the vaccine and booster at the same time I did at least. From what I hear, boosted people aren't really getting bad symptoms from it, so I'm wondering if I'm just being panicked over what could wind up being no worse than a bad cold (something I may already have had a few weeks ago around Christmas)? I have so many issues in my life these days that I can't afford any more panicking or I'll die from heart problems long before Omicron gets me.

Got my positive result Jan 13 via NHS. My isolation is over and feel absolutely fine now but still testing positive on RATs/LFTs. In order to enter Canada, one must have either a negative PCR -or- positive PCR from 11+ days ago. Am now flying home on Jan 29 which will be 11+ days from my positive test BUT: -NHS tests are apparently not acceptable for travel (the result email has all information e.g. Name, DOB, Test Date but does not have address of test provider) If do a private PCR next week (this is the acceptable type), there's a chance it's going to be positive and positive for a long time and apparently starts my isolation all over again. Have made a telephone appointment with my doctor in Canada to see if he can get me a letter confirming I'm fit for travel. But have no idea if this will be accepted with the NHS positive result and terrified of being fined at the border. With the airline I'm flying with, flights to Canada are only happening once a week. Feel angry, frustrated and upset. Why is this so hard?! Since the beginning, I have tried so hard to do everything right, stay safe and keep others safe. Now just want to go home. According to the science, I'm past the transmission stage so why can't just go home? Has anyone had a similar experience? What did you have to do? At this point, I think my best bet is to do a private PCR for the positive result and move my flight again. Not ideal, especially when I've just started a new job!

I at first tried being empathetic, had some talks with her about it, and hoped she'd come to a point where she fears COVID more than the vaccine. However, the opposite is true. She scares herself incessantly with medical articles about side effects from the vaccine and worries she'll die if she gets it. She ended up getting COVID after my dad and I got it. The entire time, I was worried she was going to die or be hospitalized due to the state of her health. Thankfully, she's ok, but her anxiety has now consumed her-- it's been weeks since and she will barely leave her room, disinfects everything, etc. She keeps me back from things in life because she wants me to protect her since she's unvaccinated. She won't allow me to see friends or get a new job. I don't see family or anything of the sort either. I'm very miserable and depressed, I love her but the untreated anxiety feels like a burden. I feel fatigued and I can't offer much empathy anymore. At some point her mental health is her responsibility. What can I do to help this situation... if anything? I'm so scared for her health.....",

I keep reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is sort of a pointless risk- why risk the side-effects of the booster when it won't even help me? But I also think, are the other/older variants (delta, original Covid) still in circulation? Maybe I should get vaccinated to protect against them? I don't know. I have already taken the first 2 doses of the <ORG> vaccine, and I took my second dose back in July 2021. I had little to no side effects. I was well enough to keep working. But I've always dreaded getting the vaccines because of the possible side-effects. I am a late thirties male in normal health and normal weight. I feel like if I have to risk side effects like myocarditis, it has to be worth it. I work from home and only leave to go shopping, so I feel like my chances of catching covid are relatively low. So my questions are As a late 30s male: * Do I risk side effects of the booster that has low efficiency against omicron? * Or should I wait for the vaccine that is customized to it? * Or should I take the booster because the older more dangerous variants are still circulating?

We had plans for her to come over during the holidays but due to omicron we had to postpone the visit and now she is coming in march. I am excited because i miss her so much but i am so anxious that im doing the wrong thing. I live with my mom (57) and grandparents, we are all vaccinated and boostered. My gf is vaxxed and boostered as well. I would pick her up from the airport and drive 3 hours to where we wanna spend 5 days, then we will come back to my house and we can get tested before coming back on day 5. It sounds solid right? i wont be putting anyone at risk, right? i know it might sound stupid but i just feel so anxious and my brain wont just relax. I feel so scared i will bring back anything to my elderly grandparents, it makes me feel selfish.",

I tested at home again and it was bright pink positive so I went from quarantining in my house to a specific room. 9/7 rolls around and I submit my covid tests to my work. They say this does not count, I have to go to an approved facility. So I find one and go get tested late 9/7. Today 9/8 I receive my results as a negative PCR test. So on record I never had it. My question is did I have it, do I have it, and should I still quarantine. Does one negitive PCR out weight symptoms and two positive Antigens? Or does the 4 days apart between the two tests negate everything? I was positive but since I have the vaccine I quickly got rid of it. My 11yr old daughter who is very sick tested positive on the antigen also and negitive the same day on the PCR. To add to this I do have <ORG> vaccine back in April/May time frame.

Epidemiologists have oddly learned that testing viral loads of municipal sewage is a remarkably accurate predictor of what will happen with cases, about a week in advance.

This correlation has proven accurate in many many municipalities across the last two years and therefore is increasingly more trusted. Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen. In the US they seem to have peaked and are falling.
